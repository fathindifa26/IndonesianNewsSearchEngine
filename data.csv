Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,"" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.""Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,"" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.""Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,"" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.""Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,"" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan

M. Hidayat Nur Wahid MA., atau HNW menerima kunjungan perwakilan korban kasus biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel, yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia. Pertemuan tersebut berlangsung di Ruang Kerja Wakil Ketua MPR Gedung Nusantara III Komplek Senayan, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Delegasi Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia dipimpin Abdul Rasyid SIQ, S. Thi, M.Si., Salah satu tujuan Kedatangan perwakilan mereka bertemu HNW, adalah untuk meminta bantuan dan dukungan terkait Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor: 365 PK/Pid.Sus/2022 tanggal 23 Mei 2022.Dalam PK, itu Mahkamah Agung (MA) memutuskan bahwa seluruh aset dalam kasus PT First Anugerah Karya Wisata (First Travel) dikembalikan ke jamaah atau korban. Tapi, hingga kini keputusan tersebut belum bisa dieksekusi.Bahkan, Kejaksaan Negeri (Kejari) Depok selaku eksekutor tengah menunggu putusan lengkap Peninjauan Kembali (PK) perkara tersebut. Kepada HNW, Abdul Rasyid mengatakan, para calon jamaah Umroh berharap bisa diberangkatkan ke tanah suci Mekah untuk melaksanakan Ibadah Umroh.""Keberangkatan ke Mekah, lebih penting dibanding menerima pengembalian biaya umroh yang telah kami bayarkan pada 2016-2017,"" kata Abdul.Ia berharap, pemerintah dalam hal ini kementerian agama membantu calon jamaah Umroh. Kami berharap pemerintah hadir dalam perkara ini, dan bertanggungjawab memberangkatkan seluruh jamaah umroh korban first Travel, sebagaimana pernah mereka janjikan, ujar Abdul.Wakil Ketua MPR Hidayat Nur Wahid menyampaikan rasa prihatin dan ikut bersimpati terhadap jamaah umroh yang gagal diberangkatkan biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel. HNW memahami, betapa kecewa dan sedihnya jamaah yang gagal diberangkatkan.Apalagi, tidak sedikit diantara mereka yang menabung selama bertahun-tahun, mengumpulkan uang untuk membayar biaya umroh. Persoalan Umroh, menurut HNW kerap dibahas oleh Komisi VIII DPR RI dengan pihak Kementerian Agama.Bahkan, untuk menjamin agar ibadah umroh bisa berjalan dengan baik, Komisi VIII mengusulkan selain adanya Dirjen Penyelenggaraan Haji juga Umroh. Sayangnya persoalan haji lebih mendapat perhatian dibanding ibadah Umroh.Ini memang belum adil, pemerintah masih memberikan perhatiannya lebih besar kepada persoalan haji dari pada persoalan calon jemaah Umroh, kata HNW.Hidayat mendukung calon jamaah Umroh yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia, tetap berusaha menuntut haknya agar bisa melaksanakan ibadah umroh. Apalagi, mereka pernah dijanjikan oleh Kementerian Agama, untuk diberangkatkan Umroh jika persoalan hukumnya telah inkracht.Perwakilan calon jemaah Umroh pun menyampaikan apresiasi dan terimakasih kepada HNW dengan berbagai saran konstruktif dan kesediaannya membantu para calon jemaah umroh.

Sehingga, dapat menginspirasi klub-klub otomotif lainnya untuk memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi kehidupan sosial kemasyarakatan.""Selamat kepada sahabat saya Ahmad Sahroni yang telah terpilih sebagai Ketua Umum HDCI periode 2023-2028 pada Musyawarah Nasional Luar Biasa tanggal 27-28 Januari 2023 di Bali,"" kata Bamsoet saat membuka Rapat Kerja Nasional (Rakernas) HDCI dan pelantikan pengurus pusat HDCI periode 2023-2028 di Semarang, Jumat malam, 3 Maret 2023.Bamsoet yakin dan percaya dengan pengalaman dan wawasan organisasi yang luas, kemampuan membangun networking yang handal, serta kecintaan yang tulus pada dunia otomotif, Ahmad Sahroni memiliki segala kualifikasi. ""Dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan untuk memimpin dan memajukan organisasi HDCI,"" ujar Bamsoet.Hadir antara lain Ketua Umum HDCI Ahmad Sahroni, Kakorlantas Polri Irjen Pol. Firman Santyabudi, Wakapolda Jawa Tengah Brigjen Pol. Abiyoso Seno Aji, Dirjen Administrasi Hukum Umum Kemenkumham Cahyo Rahadian Muzhar, Kajati DKI Jakarta Reda Manthovani dan Kajati Jawa Tengah I Made Suarnawan.Ketua DPR RI ke-20 dan mantan Ketua Komisi III DPR RI bidang Hukum, HAM, dan Keamanan ini menjelaskan, sejak didirikan pada 28 Mei 1990, HDCI terus tumbuh dan berkembang hingga memiliki puluhan ribu anggota yang tersebar di seluruh wilayah nusantara. Namun, HDCI 'besar' bukan hanya karena jumlah anggotanya.Tapi, karena kiprah dan kontribusinya dalam kehidupan masyarakat, khususnya melalui berbagai aksi sosial kemanusiaan yang diprakarsainya. ""Pada berbagai event yang diselenggarakan oleh HDCI, hampir selalu dibarengi dengan agenda bakti sosial. Bahkan pada acara pelantikan pengurus dan Rakernas kali ini, juga disertai dengan pemberian tanda kasih bagi ribuan anak yatim,"" kata Bamsoet.Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar dan Kepala Badan Hubungan Penegakan Hukum, Pertahanan dan Keamanan KADIN Indonesia ini mengatakan, kiprah positif HDCI tidak hanya dirasakan dari maraknya berbagai aksi sosial yang dilakukan. Tetapi, juga pada keberpihakan dan dukungan HDCI untuk memajukan perekonomian masyarakat.""Salah satunya melalui implementasi konsep sport automotive tourism yang menyatukan aktivitas otomotif dengan upaya memajukan sektor pariwisata, sehingga dapat mendorong geliat perekonomian rakyat, khususnya para pelaku UMKM di daerah,"" ujar Bamsoet.Ketua Umum Pengurus Besar Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat dan Wakil Ketua Umum Pemuda Pancasila menilai kiprah dan kontribusi HDCI yang telah dilakukan memiliki makna mendalam, khususnya ditengah masih adanya pandangan negatif dari sebagian masyarakat terhadap keberadaan klub motor besar. Eksistensi klub motor besar dipandang sebagai simbol eksklusivisme yang telah membentuk sekat dan kelas sosial yang membentangkan jarak dengan kelompok masyarakat lainnya.""Karena itu, saya sangat mengapresiasi komitmen Ahmad Sahroni beserta segenap jajaran pengurus HDCI, untuk menjadikan organisasi HDCI sebagai pelayan, pelindung, dan pemersatu,"" ujarnya.Menurutnya, komitmen ini mengisyaratkan adanya semangat inklusivitas, untuk merangkul semua kalangan.

Namun, Sri Mulyani menegaskan untuk terus membangun daerah secara berkelanjutan. Hal ini penting agar ke depan, tidak ada lagi terminologi daerah terpencil, daerah terluar dan daerah tertinggal di Indonesia, ujarnya.Ia melanjutkan, PT SMI memiliki peran yang sangat strategis dalam memenuhi kebutuhan pembiayaan pembangunan, sehingga diharapkan transformasi PT SMI menjadi Development Financial Institution menjadi ladang untuk menciptakan jejak peninggalan bagi pembangunan.Direktur Utama PT SMI Edwin Syahruzad memberi paparan kepada Menteri Keuangan mengenai capaian kinerja serta milestone yang berhasil dijalankan selama 14 tahun berdirinya PT SMI.Dalam mencapai target ini, sejak pendiriannya pada tahun 2009, PT SMI telah melaksanakan berbagai inovasi dan kreasi pembiayaan infrastruktur dalam rangka menjadi katalis pembiayaan pembangunan nasional melalui tiga pilar bisnis utama yaitu Pembiayaan dan Investasi, Jasa Konsultasi dan Pengembangan Proyek. Hal ini diukur dari keterlibatan PT SMI dalam pembiayaan 435 proyek infrastruktur dengan berbagai inovasi produk pembiayaan.Hingga tahun 2022, PT SMI terlibat dalam pembiayaan infrastruktur dengan total nilai proyek sebesar Rp 819,94 triliun yang menghasilkan multiplier effect 5,6 kali dari nilai total komitmen pembiayaan dan 26,87 kali dari modal disetor.Dalam menjalankan perannya sebagai katalis pembangunan Indonesia, PT SMI juga senantiasa aktif dalam mencari alternatif sumber pendanaan seperti penerbitan Green Bond dan Global Bond serta pelibatan dan kolaborasi dengan sektor privat pada sindikasi proyek-proyek infrastruktur. Inovasi dan inisiatif ini telah dan dapat terus mengoptimalkan leveraging terhadap asset PT SMI.Selama pandemi COVID-19, peran PT SMI terasa semakin besar. Sebagai alat countercyclical Pemerintah, PT SMI ikut bekerja keras untuk menanggulangi dampak perubahan situasi ekonomi di daerah yang signifikan melalui program pinjaman Pemulihan Ekonomi Nasional (PEN) Daerah.Edwin menyampaikan, ada 92 Pemerintah Daerah yang telah menerima manfaat pinjaman program PEN hingga Desember 2022, dengan total komitmen sebesar Rp 34,7 triliun. PT SMI telah berpartisipasi pada pembiayaan daerah sejak 2015, melalui engalihan aset dan peran Pusat Investasi Pemerintah sebagai lembaga pembiayaan untuk pemerintah daerah kepada PT SMI.Dalam penyaluran dana PEN, kami senantiasa menjaga integritas dan akuntabilitas. Salah satu inovasi yang kami lakukan untuk menjaganya adalah melalui transformasi digital pengajuan pinjaman daerah melalui Regional Financing System (ReFina), sehingga akuntabilitas dan transparansi dapat terukur.Sebagai informasi, ReFina meraih penghargaan Peringkat 1 Inovasi Terbaik dari Kementerian Keuangan pada Februari 2023.Dalam menjawab tantangan pembangunan ekonomi daerah yang memerlukan pemerataan akses antar daerah terhadap infrastruktur sesuai karakteristiknya, saat ini PT SMI sedang disiapkan untuk bertransformasi menjadi Lembaga Pembiayaan Pembangunan Nasional.Untuk menunjang proses transformasi tersebut salah satu inisiatif yang akan dibentuk oleh PT SMI pada ulang tahun ke-14 ini adalah peluncuran SMI Institute. Terdapat tiga program utama yang akan menjadi fokus, yaitu program research & fellowship, capacity building & training, serta knowledge sharing.Kami menyusun tiga program utama untuk pemerintah daerah sebagai pelengkap pembiayaan pembangunan daerah yang inklusif dan berkelanjutan ucap Edwin.Momentum Presidensi G20 Indonesia 2022 juga menjadi ajang PT SMI dalam menunjukkan kapabilitasnya untuk mendukung pemerintah demi mengatasi tantangan global khususnya dampak perubahan iklim (climate change).Kepercayaan Pemerintah untuk menunjuk PT SMI sebagai Country Platform Manager undalamtuk mengelola pembiayaan mekanisme transisi energi di Indonesia pada Presidensi G20 Indonesia 2022 di Bali merupakan bentuk apresiasi Kementerian Keuangan atas capaian platform SDG Indonesia One  sebuah platform blended finance untuk membiayai proyek-proyek adaptasi dan mitigasi perubahan iklim - yang telah dikelola oleh PT SMI sejak 2018.PT SMI sejauh ini telah berhasil meningkatkan reputasi Indonesia di mata dunia, melalui perannya sebagai Energy Transition Mechanism Country Platform Manager. Untuk itu, PT SMI perlu secara ambisius dan agresif melakukan tindak lanjut atas dukungan-dukungan yang diberikan kepada Indonesia untuk agenda transisi energi.Hingga Februari 2023, PT SMI telah bekerja sama dengan 17 lembaga mitra untuk menyusun strategi pembiayaan dan investasi transisi energi melalui dukungan-dukungan yang tersedia baik dalam bentuk dana komersil maupun non-komersil seperti dana hibah maupun bantuan teknis.Lembaga yang menjadi mitra PT SMI dalam perannya sebagai ETM Country Platform Manager terdiri dari lembaga multilateral, bilateral, bank, filantropi dan think tank. Edwin menambahkan, dalam menyusun skema pembiayaan dan investasi transisi energi di Indonesia, aspek lingkungan dan sosial merupakan prioritas.PT SMI bersama dengan Asian Development Bank telah menyusun Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment, dimana akan dilakukan audit, identifikasi risiko, dan penyiapan rencana mitigasi risiko dari aspek lingkungan dan sosial sebagai dasar rekomendasi skenario transisi energi. Ini dilakukan untuk mencapai tujuan transisi energi di Indonesia agar dapat dilakukan secara adil dan terjangkau ujar Edwin.Baru-baru ini, PT SMI sedang disiapkan oleh Pemerintah Indonesia melalui Kementerian Keuangan untuk mendukung pelaksanaan penyiapan proyek Ibu Kota Negara. PT SMI akan berperan strategis dalam penyusunan inovasi pembiayaan penyediaan infrastruktur terhadap Otorita Ibu Kota Negara.Kepercayaan Pemerintah terhadap PT SMI merupakan afirmasi terhadap kinerja PT SMI dalam menjalankan berbagai mandat penyiapan proyek untuk 20 proyek infrastruktur dari berbagai variasi sektor antara lain Rumah Sakit, Pengelolaan Limbah B3, Pengelolaan Sampah, Akses Broadband, Transportasi, dan Sistem Penyediaan Air Minum.Dalam menjalankan seluruh mandat dan kegiatan bisnisnya, integritas, akuntabilitas dan transparansi menjadi aspek yang selalu dijaga oleh PT SMI. Saat ini PT SMI telah tersertifikasi ISO 37001 Sistem Manajemen Anti Penyuapan, serta terus memperketat pengawasan melalui kerja sama dengan penegak hukum yaitu Komisi Pemberatasan Korupsi (KPK) dan Jaksa Agung Muda Bidang Perdata dan Tata Usaha Negara (JAMDATUN), serta lembaga negara lainnya seperti Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan (BPK), Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan (BPKP) dan Inspektorat Jenderal Kementerian Keuangan.Tentunya capaian prestasi-prestasi ini dilakukan dengan prinsip tata kelola perusahaan yang baik serta penyempurnaan kerangka manajemen risiko yang selalu mengikuti tantangan yang dihadapi. Hal ini membuat PT SMI selalu mejadi enabler dalam menjawab tantangan ekonomi global, nasional, dan daerah, Kami berkomitmen untuk terus melakukan inovasi, sinergi, dan kolaborasi dengan berbagai pihak dalam membangun negeri dan memenuhi kesejahteraan masyarakat Indonesia di masa sekarang maupun generasi mendatang.

88,tempo,Penundaan Pemilu 2024 Bisa Buat Jokowi 3 Periode? Ini Mereka yang Pernah Menyuarakan ,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/04/01/id_1099907/1099907_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698557/penundaan-pemilu-2024-bisa-buat-jokowi-3-periode-ini-mereka-yang-pernah-menyuarakan,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Wacana Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi 3 periode tak kunjung surut. Keputusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat mengetok palu yang berarti penundaan Pemilu 2024, mengindikasikan Jokowi kudu menjabat hingga 2025. Majelis Hakim tersebut meminta Komisi Pemilihan Umum atau KPU menunda Pemilu selama dua tahun empat bulan.Keputusan itu buntut laporan Partai Prima yang merasa dirugikan karena tak lolos sebagai partai peserta Pemilu 2024. PN Jakarta Pusat menyatakan KPU telah melakukan tindakan melawan hukum. Sebab itu, lembaga yang berwenang terhadap pemilihan eksekutif dan yudikatif itu diminta tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Berikut sejumlah deretan wacana Jokowi 3 periode yang pernah digaungkan sejumlah pihak:1. Guru asal Dumai Herifuddin DaulayPertengahan Desember 2022 lalu, Seorang guru di Dumai, Riau, Herifuddin Daulay, membangkitkan isu perpanjangan masa jabatan presiden. Dia mengajukan gugatan uji materiil terhadap aturan masa jabatan Presiden dan Wakil Presiden di Mahkamah Konstitusi. Gugatan ditujukan kepada Pasal 169 huruf n dan Pasal 227 huruf I Undang-Undang Nomor 7 Tahun 2017 tentang Pemilihan Umum alias UU Pemilu.Menurut Herifuddin, kedua pasal UU Pemilu bertentangan dengan UUD 1945. Dalam alasan permohonan, Herifuddin menilai telah ada kesalahan dalam teks Pasal 7 UUD 1945 yang mengatur masa jabatan Presiden dan Wakil Presiden selama 2 periode. Padahal, Pasal 7 inilah yang diturunkan menjadi UU Pemilu.Pemohon berkesimpulan bahwa lebih besar mudharat ketimbang manfaat dari adanya aturan pembatasan jabatan presiden, demikian bunyi salah satu poin alasan Herifuddin dalam perkara nomor 4/PUUXXI/2023 ini.2. Ketua Umum DPP APDESI Surta WijayaKetua Umum DPP Asosiasi Pemerintah Desa Indonesia atau APDESI Surta Wijaya juga pernah menyerukan dukungan Presiden Jokowi 3 periode. Seruan itu dikumandangkan olehnya saat aksi di Istora Senayan pada Selasa 29 Maret 2022 lalu. Pihaknya menilai Jokowi harus didukung menjabat tiga periode lantaran kepala desa merasa terbantu dengan pemerintahan Jokowi. Antara lain, kata dia, Jokowi telah mengabulkan tuntutan para kepala desa yakni mengubah aturan mekanisme gaji kepala desa dari tiga bulan sekali menjadi sebulan sekali.Setelah membuat pernyataan mendukung Jokowi 3 periode, Surta mendapat berbagai kecaman. Salah satunya dari Ketua Umum DPP APDESI, Arifin Abdul Majid. Menurutnya setelah pertemuan di Istora Senayan timbul gejolak di internal. Arifin mengatakan pihaknya tidak pernah menyatakan dukungan tiga periode untuk presiden dan meluruskan bahwa Apdesi yang sah berdasarkan SK Kementerian Hukum dan HAM adalah yang di bawah dirinya.3. Partai Bulan BintangPartai Bulan Bintang atau juga pernah mengembuskan isu Jokowi tiga periode. Hal itu terungkap saat Sekretaris Jenderal PBB Afriansyah Noor berpidato membuka Rapat Koordinasi Nasional partai itu di Kelapa Gading, Jakarta Utara pada Rabu, 11 Januari 2023. Yang paling cocok memimpin kita saat ini hanya Bapak Joko Widodo. Selebihnya belum ada, karena kami belum putuskan siapa, ungkap AfriansyahMenurutnya, bila undang-undang bisa secara konstitusional melanggengkan kekuasaan Jokowi, PBB pasti akan memilih kembali sang presiden. Karena apa? Semua calon presiden yang disebutkan ini omdo (omong doang), kata Afriansyah. Mendengar pidato tersebut, Presiden Jokowi yang hadir dalam acara tersebut terlihat hanya tertawa dan menggelengkan kepala.4. Ketua MPR Bambang SoesatyoSebelumnya, Ketua MPR Bambang Soesatyo juga telah mencuatkan isu Jokowi tiga periode. Wacana itu muncul setelah terbitnya hasil survei yang menyebut kepuasan publik atas kinerja presiden masih tinggi. Klaim Bamsoet ini mengutip hasil survei Poltracking yang menyebut 73,2 persen responden puas dengan kinerja pemerintah.Politikus Partai Golkar itu kemudian mempertanyakan apakah kepuasan publik berbanding lurus dengan keinginan agar Jokowi tetap menjabat. Meski begitu, Bamsoet sadar bahwa isu Jokowi tiga periode mendapat banyak pertentangan dari banyak pihak. Namun, dia menyebut ada pula masyarakat yang menginginkan agar Jokowi tetap terus menjabat tiga periode.Terlepas itu, saya sendiri ingin tau keinginan publik yang sesungguhnya ini apa? Apakah kepuasan ini ada korelasinya dengan keinginan masyarakat beliau tetap memimpin kita dalam masa transisi ini, kata Bamsoet.5. Relawan JokowiTeriakan Jokowi 3 periode menggema di acara Nusantara Bersatu di Stadion Gelora Bung Karno, Jakarta Pusat, Sabtu, 26 November 2022. Presiden Jokowi pun menanggapi teriakan dari para relawan yang hadir itu. Jokowi tiga periode, tiga periode, teriak relawan saat Jokowi menyapa dari atas panggung. Teriakan tersebut disambut Jokowi dengan tawa.Dari pantauan Tempo, Jokowi tersenyum dan membentuk angka tiga dengan jarinya merespon teriakan para relawan tersebut. Selain itu, para relawan yang hadir tampak mengenakan baju dengan tulisan 2024 ikut Jokowi. Spanduk kecil yang menyatakan relawan bakal patuh terhadap Jokowi pada Pilpres 2024 juga dibawa oleh relawan.6. Kepala BKPM Bahlil LahadaliaMelansir Antara, Menteri Investasi/Kepala Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal atau BKPM Bahlil Lahadalia juga pernah mengusulkan Jokowi 3 periode dan menunda Pemilu 2024. Bahlil dalam acara rilis temuan survei Indikator Politik Indonesia pada Senin, 10 Januari 2022 menyebut para pelaku usaha di Indonesia ingin agar Pemilu 2024 diundur.

126,tempo,Jokowi Ingin Pindahkan Depo Pertamina dari Pemukiman: Lindungi Obyek Vital,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/05/id_1186254/1186254_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698819/jokowi-ingin-pindahkan-depo-pertamina-dari-pemukiman-lindungi-obyek-vital,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Buffer zone atau kawasan penyangga yang memisahkan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, dengan pemukiman warga kini menuai sorotan, karena sudah diusulkan sejak 2009 silam. Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi yang pernah menjadi Gubernur DKI Jakarta 2012-2014 mengakui usulan tersebut juga dibahas di era kepemimpinannya.""Dulu memang sudah direncanakan untuk dibuat air di kanan kirinya sungai, tetapi memang belum sampai kepada titik mencarikan solusi kepada penduduknya yang ada di situ,"" kata Jokowi saat ditemui mengunjungi para pengungsi kebakaran Depo Pertamina di RPTRA Rasela, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Minggu, 5 Maret 2023.""Tanah merah-nya ini kan padat dan penuh. Semuanya harus dicarikan solusi. Saya kira keamanan masyarakat, keselamatan masyarakat harus menjadi titik yang utama,"" kata dia. Tanah Merah mengacu pada Jalan Tanah Merah Bawah yang jadi lokasi kebakaran.Jokowi menyebut seharusnya zona ini harusnya menjadi zona air, seperti misalnya dibuat sungai yang memisahkan Depo dan pemukiman. Tujuannya untuk melindungi objek vital yang ada di dalam Depo. ""Karena barang-barang didalamnya barang-barang yang sangat bahaya untuk berdekatan dengan masyarakat, apalagi dengan pemukiman penduduk,"" kata dia.Heru Ungkit Buffer ZoneSebelumnya, kebakaran terjadi di Depo Pertamina pada Jumat malam, pukul 20.11 WIB, 3 Maret 2023. Usulan soal buffer zone ini diungkit Heru saat mengunjungi lokasi kebakaran pada Jumat malam tersebut.Heru menyebut tahun 2009, pemerintah daerah sudah mengusulkan buffer zone selebar 50 meter. Akan tetapi, Heru tak menjelaskan lagi apakah buffer zone ini sudah dibuat, atau hanya dibuat untuk beberapa titik saja.""Kira-kira begitu, kami kembalikan ke Pertamina,"" kata Heru usai menggelar rapat darurat di Pos Koramil Koja, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu dini hari, 4 Maret 2023. Heru pernah jadi Wali Kota Jakarta Utara 2014-2015 di era Gubernur DKI Jokowi, lalu berlanjut ke era Gubernur DKI Basuki Tjahaja Purnama alias Ahok.Sekretaris Daerah DKI Jakarta Joko Agus Setyono mengatakan Pemerintah Provinsi akan berkerja sama dengan Pertamina untuk melanjutkan rencana pembuatan buffer zone di kawasan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara. ""Kita bikin kerja sama, lah, sama Pertamina,"" kata Joko kepada wartawan di Koramil Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Namun, eks Kepala BPK Bali itu belum merinci soal pembuatan buffer zone ini. ""Ya, pastinya, semuanya itu, upaya-upaya untuk mengarah yang lebih bagus,"" ujarnya.Era Fauzi BowoTahun 2019, Jakarta dipimpin oleh Gubernur Fauzi Bowo. Kala itu, Tempo memberitakan bahwa Kawasan Tanah Merah, Plumpang, Jakarta Utara dipastikan akan dibersihkan di tahun tersebut. Wilayah tersebut akan dibangun buffer zone Depo Pertamina Plumpang.""Pemerintah pusat mentargetkan 2009 ini buffer zone selesai dibangun,"" kata Walikota Jakarta Utara, Bambang Sugiyono di ruang kerjanya, akhir pekan lalu.Proses pembangunan dan pembebasan lahan di Tanah Merah, kata Bambang, dilakukan oleh Tim Penataan Depo Plumpang yang duduk sebagai penanggung jawab adalah Gubernur DKI Fauzi Bowo, dan Wakil Gubernur Prijanto sebagai pelaksana. ""Wali Kota mengerjakan inventarisasi, penyuluhan, dan pembebasan,"" kata Bambang.Proses pembangunan zona penyangga tersebut, lanjut Bambang, sudah memasuki tahap inventarisasi dan sosialisasi kepada warga. Ia mengakui tahap ini tergolong sulit, khususnya memverifikasi pemilik lahan sebenarnya. ""Bermacam-macam. Ada yang punya sertifikat tanah, agendum, dan lainnya,"" ujarnya.IMB Anies DisorotSelain buffer zone, masalah status lahan dan bangunan warga pun jadi sorotan. Anggota Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPRD DKI Jakarta Gilbert Simanjuntak menyatakan sepatutnya mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan ikut bertanggungjawab atas kebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat malam lalu.Menurut Gilbert, sejak awal sudah diketahui bahwa lahan di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang tidak boleh ada permukiman dalam jarak tertentu. Lahan yang terkena kebakaran tadi adalah milik PT Pertamina.""Lahan milik PT Pertamina ditempati warga akan tetapi oleh Anies sewaktu menjabat Gubernur diberi IMB, yang jelas bertentangan dengan peraturan,"" ujar Gilbert dalam keterangannya pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Gilbert menilai IMB yang dikeluarkan Anies Baswedan saat menjabat Gubernur DKI membuat persoalan semakin rumit. Menurut dia, saat itu Anies terkesan lebih mementingkan pemenuhan janji kampanye walau harus menabrak aturan. ""Kesalahan itu tidak sepatutnya berulang.""Berkaca dari kejadian tersebut, Gilbert penduduk di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang dipindahkan agar tidak menjadi korban lagi.Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan menerbitkan IMB (Izin Mendirikan Bangunan) Sementara kepada penduduk Kampung Tanah Merah pada Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.""Ini adalah jalan tengah yang kami ambil untuk menyelesaikan masalah bangunan-bangunan yang berada di tanah yang status legalnya belum tuntas. Tapi mereka faktanya ada di tempat ini sudah puluhan tahun,"" kata Anies Baswedan di Kampung Tanah Merah, Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.Pertamina enggan berkomentar lebih lanjut ketika ditanya mengenai

""Menjadi catatan penting adalah bahwa jangan sampai hanya menilai soal putusannya tetapi bagaimana majelis hakim ini mengambil langkah putusan. Nah ini harus didalami oleh Komisi Yudisial,"" ujar Ramadhan Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Menurut PSHK, penggalian motif bertujuan untuk mengurangi spekulasi adanya agenda penundaan Pemilu di masyarakat.""Memang perlu dipertanyakan dan juga hal ini perlu diperdalam oleh pihak-pihak termasuk masyarakat sipil ya. Dalam hal ini untuk melihat apakah memang benar sesuai dengan apa yang mereka yakini atau di balik ini memang ada sesuatu yang terjadi,"" katanya.Peneliti Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) Kurnia Ramadhana mengatakan kecurigaan penundaan Pemilu 2024 adalah hal yang wajar karena sebelumnya Menko Marinves Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, hingga Ketua MPR Bambang Soesatyo yang pernah mengungkapkan wacana penundaan Pemilu 2024 ke publik.""Tentu kita masih ingat dan menjadi hal wajar jika masyarakat khawatir menanggapi putusan pengadilan negeri Jakarta pusat karena dua tiga tahun ke belakang banyak sekali politisi yang menggaungkan wacana penundaan pemilu misalnya Menkomarinves Luhut binsar Panjaitan dengan big datanya. Kemudian, Ketua Umum PAN Zulkifli Hasan dan juga Ketua Umum Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa Muhaimin. Lalu ada Bahlil menteri BKPM kemudian baru-baru ini ada Ketua MPR Bambang Susatyo,"" ujarnya.Sebelumnya, Juru Bicara Komisi Yudisal (KY) Miko Ginting menyampaikan pihaknya tengah mendalami putusan Hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat perihal putusanpenundaan Pemilupada persidangan perdata Partai Prima 2 Maret 2023. RencananyaKomisi Yudisialakan memanggil ketiga Hakim PN Jakarta Pusat yaitu T. Oyong, H. Bakri, dan Dominggus Silaban.""Untuk itu, KY akan melakukan pendalaman terhadap putusan itu, terutama untuk melihat apakah ada dugaan pelanggaran perilaku yang terjadi. Salah satu bagian dari pendalaman itu bisa jadi dengan memanggil hakim untuk dimintakan klarifikasi."" ujarnya dalam keterangan tertulis pada 3 Maret 2023.KY juga telah berkomunikasi bersama Mahkamah Agung dalam mencermati substansi putusan yang dibuat oleh para Hakim tersebut""Kami juga akan berkomunikasi dengan Mahkamah Agung terkait dengan putusan ini serta aspek perilaku hakim yang terkait.""ucapnya.Menurutnya, Putusan Pengadilan sudah seharusnya bersandar aspek demokratis, aspek aspirasi masyarakat secara sosiologis dan patuh pada Undang-Undang Dasar 1945.""Putusan pengadilan tidak bekerja di ruang hampa karena ada aspirasi yang hidup di masyarakat secara sosiologis, ada aspek yuridis di mana kepatuhan terhadap UUD 1945 dan undang-undang sangatlah penting, serta pertimbangan-pertimbangan lain, seperti nilai-nilai demokrasi."" ujarnya.Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusatmemerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Perintah tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukanPartai Primadengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Putusan tersebut dibacakan oleh Majelis Hakim pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.

Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan setelah dinyatakan tidak lolos dalam verifikasi administrasi untuk menjadi Pemilu 2024.Dalam putusannya, PN Jakarta Pusatmerintahkan KPU untuk menghentikan tahapan pemilu yang telah berjalan. Majelis hakim juga memerintahkan KPU untuk mengulang seluruh tahapan pemilu sejak awal.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Selain menunda pemilu, hakim juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta. Pengadilan juga menyatakan bahwa penggugat, yakni Partai Prima adalah partai politik yang dirugikan dalam verifikasi administrasi.Putusan tersebut dianggap cacat hukum dan menyalahi konstitusi.

Komisioner Komnas HAM Hari Kurniawan mengatakan tim tersebut independen dengan tidak ada unsur dari TNI dan Polri.""Tim investigasi Komnas HAM ini tidak melibatkan TNI-Polri karena mereka sebagai pihak yang diperiksa Komnas HAM konteks peristiwa Wamena,"" ujar dia pada Jum'at 3 Maret 2023.Ihwal perkembangan investigasi, Hari mengatakan tim independen Komnas HAM masih mengembangkan fakta-fakta di lapangan. Menurutnya tim baru mendapatkan temuan awal.""Hasil investigasi awal memang ada isu penculikan anak. Ini kan belum sedetail itu. Baru ada informasi bahwa pelaku sudah diamankan oleh polisi,"" kata Hari saat ditemui di Kantor Komnas HAM, Jakarta.Hari berujar tim Komnas HAM belum menemukan indikasi penculikan. Namun, kata dia, tim sudah menemukan indikasi kekerasan aparat terhadap masyarakat sipil. ""Kesimpulan awal, ya. Tapi teman-teman di Wamena masih terus bekerja di sana,"" ujar dia.Hari membenarkan ada dugaan kekerasan yang dilakukan aparat. Meski begitu, kata dia, masih terlalu dini untuk menyimpulkan hal tersebut. ""Ada dugaan aparat terlibat di situ, tapi saya belum berani berbicara detail. Sebab masih dilakukan investigasi,"" kata Hari.Mengenai dugaan adanya penembakan oleh aparat, Hari mengatakan hingga saat ini tim yang dikirim masih belum menemukannya.""Belum, kalau Komnas HAM belum menemukannya. Makanya tadi dibilang untuk memperdalam investigasi pekan depan untuk turunkan tim ke Wamena,"" kata Hari.Dipicu Isu Penculikan AnakKekerasan di Wamena, Papua, 23 Februari 2023 bermula dari rumor penculikan anak oleh dua orang pedagang. Massa mengamuk setelah melihat dua orang penjual kelontong menggunakan mobil dan menuduh mereka sebagai penculik. Massa yang marah kemudian terprovokasi meski tokoh masyarakat berupaya menenangkannya. Massa tetap menyerang aparat. Pasca kejadian tersebut, sejumlah mahasiswa Papua mengadakan aksi di depan Kantor Komnas HAM pada 3 Maret 2023 lalu. Aksi tersebut dilakukan untuk mendesak Komnas HAM menerjunkan tim untuk menyelidiki kasus tersebut.""Itu kami mau nuntut melaporkan peristiwa di Wamena dan kami follow up peristiwa sebelumnya kami

Terbaru, Pengadilan Negeri atau PN Jakarta Pusat mengetok palu Pemilu 2024 ditunda hingga 2025. Keputusan tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukan Partai Prima dengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Vonis Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat itu menambah daftar pewacana penundaan Pemilu 2024. Berikut sejumlah pihak yang pernah menggaungkan agar Pemilu ditunda.Ketua Umum Golkar Airlangga Hartarto (tengah), Ketua Umum PAN Zulkifli Hasan (kiri) dan Plt Ketua Umum PPP Mardiono, melakukan pertemuan di Restoran Bunga Rampai, Jakarta, Rabu, 30 November 2022.

PLt Ketum PPP Muhammad MardionoWacana penundaan pemilu 2024 kembali bergulir pada awal Februari lalu. Usulan itu diembuskan lagi oleh pelaksana tugas Ketua Umum Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (PPP) Muhammad Mardiono. Sosok yang juga menjabat sebagai Utusan Khusus Presiden Bidang Kerja Sama Pengentasan Kemiskinan dan Ketahanan Pangan itu awalnya menilai masyarakat tidak terlalu antusias menyambut Pemilu 2024. Dia juga mengaku sempat berkeliling ke-30 provinsi dan melihat masyarakat lebih peduli pada pemulihan ekonomi ketimbang Pemilu.Antusiasme masyarakat menanggapi pemilu itu saya lihat tidak begitu respon tinggi, tetapi agak dingin, ujarnya saat dihubungi, Sabtu, 4 Februari 2023.Mardiono mengingatkan, Indonesia termasuk negara yang masih pada tahap recovery dari trauma pandemi Covid-19. Sehingga, menurutnya, pelaksanaan tahun politik jangan sampai merusak pemulihan masyarakat dari trauma usai hadapi dua tahun belakangan akibat Covid-19. Jangan sampai tahun politik ini mengganggu pada situasi masyarakat atau rakyat yang masih trauma itu, ujarnya.2. Ketum Partai Golkar Airlangga HartartoKetum Partai Golkar Airlangga Hartarto merupakan salah satu pihak yang mendukung wacana Cak Imin. Bahkan pihaknya mengatakan wacana penundaan Pemilu 2024 tersebut merupakan aspirasi dari masyarakat. Hal ini disampaikan Airlangga seusai bertemu Ketua Umum Partai NasDem Surya Paloh di NasDem Tower, Jakarta, Kamis, 10 Maret 2022.Kita musti mengerti yang namanya aspirasi itu tidak boleh ditolak, apalagi kita suara Golkar suara rakyat, tutur Airlangga.Lagi pula, kata Airlangga, Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi menyatakan bahwa aspirasi demokratis tetap harus dipegang teguh. Terlebih tantangan permasalahan yang dihadapi Indonesia ke depan makin berat.3. Ketum PAN Zulkifli HasanKetum Partai Amanat Nasional ata7 PAN, Zulkifli Hasan, juga pernah menyatakan dukungan atas usulan penundaan Pemilu 2024 oleh Cak Imin. Menurut sosok yang akrab dipanggil Zulhas itu, terdapat sejumlah alasan dirinya mendukung usulan tersebut. Antara lain soal angka kepuasan terhadap pemerintahan Jokowi.Berbagai survei menyebut angkanya (kepuasan terhadap Jokowi) di atas 73 persen, ujar Zulhas di Gedung Parlemen, Jumat, 28 Januari 2022.Jokowi masih harus menjabat setelah 2024, menurut Hasan karena pertama situasi pandemi yang masih berlangsung dan memerlukan perhatian khusus. Lalu kondisi perekonomian yang belum stabil, sehingga pemerintah, dunia usaha, maupun masyarakat masih perlu melakukan pemulihan. Perkembangan situasi konflik global yang perlu diantisipasi, di antaranya perang Rusia-Ukraina dan tidak menentunya harga minyak dunia.Lalu anggaran Pemilu yang justru membengkak dari rencana efisiensi, sehingga lebih baik dikonsentrasikan untuk kepentingan kesejahteraan rakyat. Terakhir, keberlangsungan program-program pembangunan nasional yang sebelumnya tertunda akibat pandemi. Mempertimbangkan hal-hal tersebut, serta setelah mendengar masukan dan aspirasi dari berbagai kalangan, PAN setuju bahwa pemilu perlu dipertimbangkan untuk diundur, kata Zulhas.Wakil Ketua DPR RI Abdul Muhaimin Iskandar.

Wakil Ketua DPR RI itu mengusulkan agar Pemilu 2024 ditunda selama satu atau dua tahun. Saya mengusulkan Pemilu 2024 ditunda satu atau dua tahun. Usulan ini nanti akan saya sampaikan ke pimpinan-pimpinan partai dan presiden, ujar Muhaimin lewat keterangan tertulis, Rabu, 23 Februari 2022.Menurut Muhaimin, wacana itu terlintas olehnya usai bersua dengan pelaku usaha mikro, pengusaha dan para analis ekonomi dari berbagai perbankan di Ruang Delegasi DPR, Nusantara III, Jakarta, Rabu, 23 Februari 2022. Mereka memprediksi Indonesia akan mengalami momentum perbaikan ekonomi usai dua tahun pandemi Covid-19. Menurut Muhaimin, momentum ini tak boleh terganggu dengan adanya pesta politik.Menteri Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan Investasi Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.

Nah, inilah yang mau kita zoning ulang, tata ulang, tidak hanya di Pertamina, termasuk PLN, termasuk pupuk,"" kata Erick.Dengan adanya zoning wilayah aman antara pemukiman warga dan objek vital, diharapkan masyarakat bisa lebih aman.

Idham Holik menyatakan bahwa KPU menolak putusan PN Jakpus.""KPU RI akan banding atas putusan PN tersebut. KPU tegas menolak putusan PN tersebut dan ajukan banding, kata Idham pada Kamis lalu.Pasal 431 UU Pemilu menyatakan bahwa pemilu lanjutan digelar sebagian atau di seluruh wilayah Indonesia jika terjadi kerusuhan, gangguan keamanan, bencana alam, atau gangguan lainnya yang mengakibatkan sebagian tahapan penyelenggaraaan pemilu tidak dapat dilaksanakan. Pelaksanaan pemilu lanjutan dimulai dari tahap yang terhenti.Adapun Pasal 432 menjelaskan jika kejadian dalam pasal 431 mengakibatkan seluruh tahapan penyelenggaraan pemilu tidak dapat dilaksanakan, maka dilakukan pemilu susulan.

Oyong, dengan hakim anggota H. Bakri dan Dominggus Silaban.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum. Adapun perbuatan melawan hukum yang dimaksud adalah KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik calon peserta pemilu.Selain penundaan, pengadilan juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta.

Sebab, menurut dia, pertemuan dua pihak itu bisa merusak hubungan yang terjalin antara pemerintah Indonesia dengan Fiji.""Kontak antara Rabuka dengan Wenda ini bisa merusak hubungan bilateral Fiji-Indonesia yang berdasarkan prinsip saling menghargai kedaulatan dan keutuhan wilayah,"" kata pengajar Universitas Padjadjaran tersebut pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Reza mengatakan dalam jangka pendek, pertemuan antara Sitivani Rabuka dan Benny Wenda bisa menguntungkan gerakan separatis Papua. Sebab, hal tersebut bisa menjadi simbol dukungan sehingga bisa menguatkan posisi Benny Wenda.""Dimana Wenda akan mendapat dukungan dari kalangan Melanesia di Pasifik Selatan, yakni pemerintah, kalangan dunia usaha, agama, dan masyarakat umum,"" kata dia melalui pesan tertulis saat dihubungi Tempo.Namun, Reza menyebut komunikasi Rabuka-Wenda berpotensi berakibat buruk terhadap hubungan bilateral antara RI dengan Fiji ke depan karena bisa memancing respon negatif dari masyarakat. ""Serta membuat gundah masyarakat masyarakat di dalam negeri Indonesia, khususnya di Indonesia bagian Timur,"" ujar Reza.Selain itu, Reza mengatakan pertemuan antara Wenda-Rabuka bisa merugikan kondisi sosio-politik masyarakat Indonesia. Ia menilai hal tersebut bisa menjadi angin segar pihak tertentu melancarkan aksi tidak baik mereka. ""Akan terdapat kalangan tertentu yang mengambil manfaat dari pertemuan tersebut, dan menafsirkannya secara berlebihan,"" tutur dia.Reza mengatakan pertemuan tersebut bisa jadi ujian bagi pemerintah Indonesia. Ia menyebut pemerintah harus bisa menekan semua potensi gejolak yang mungkin bisa terjadi.""Namun gejolak di Papua dapat dihindari. Sekiranya pemerintah Indonesia dapat membuktikan sudah terjadinya integrasi budaya dalam masyarakat Indonesia di Provinsi Papua dan Provinsi Papua Barat, di mana semuanya hidup damai sebagai penduduk Indonesia,"" kata Reza.Indonesia Kecewa pada FijiSebelumnya, Pemimpin Persatuan Gerakan Pembebasan Papua Barat (ULMWP) Benny Wenda membagikan foto pertemuannya dengan Perdana Menteri Fiji Sitivani Rabuka. Hal tersebut diunggah oleh Wenda melalui akun Twitter resminya,""Suatu kehormatan untuk bertemu dengan Anda berdua dan mendiskusikan masa depan Melanesia dan Pasifik yang lebih luas,"" kata Benny Wenda dalam cuitannya.Menanggapi hal itu, Pemerintah RI sempat menyatakan rasa keberatannya. Juru Bicara Kementerian Luar Negeri RI Teuku Faizasyah mengatakan pemerintah telah menyampaikan nota diplomatik kepada Pemerintah Fiji pada 2 Maret 2023 lalu.""Kurang lebihnya dalan nota tersebut

Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023 lalu, Majelis Hakim yang diketuai Hakim Oyong atau Tengku Oyong memutuskan Komisi Pemilihan Umum menunda Pemilu. Vonis itu buntut dari gugatan Partai Prima yang tak terima gagal jadi peserta Pemilu 2024.Majelis Hakim menyebut KPU telah melakukan tindakan melawan hukum. Pasalnya, KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik. Karena itu, PN Jakarta Pusat menghukum KPU untuk tak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024. Jeda itu berlangsung selama dua tahun, empat bulan atau hingga 2025. Arinya, bisa mengakibatkan Pemilu 2024 ditunda.Hakim Oyong merupakan hakim madya utama dengan pangkat pembina utama muda (IV/C) di PN Jakarta Pusat. Dia dimutasi ke PN Jakarta Pusat setelah sebelumnya bertugas di PN Medan. Dirangkum dari berbagai sumber, T Oyong tercatat pernah menangani sejumlah perkara. Berikut kasus-kasus yang pernah ditangani T Oyong.1. Kasus Gugatan Fadel Muhammad kepada La Nyalla dan MahyudinSaat bertugas di PN Jakpus, T Oyong pernah menangani gugatan yang dilayangkan anggota DPD RI Fadel Muhammad. Gugatan tersebut ditujukan kepada tergugat I Ketua DPD La Nyalla Mahmud Mattalitti, dan tergugat II Ketua DPD RI Mahyudin. Fadel menggugat keduanya lantaran dicopot dari jabatannya sebagai Wakil Ketua MPR dari unsur DPD. Ketika itu, gugatan Fadel ditolak. PN Jakarta Pusat menyatakan tidak berwenang mengadili Surat Keputusan DPD RI atas hasil Sidang Paripurna Lembaga Negara tersebut.2. Kasus penipuan Eks Calon Dirut Bank Sumut Freddy HutabaratT Oyong juga pernah menangani perkara kasus mantan calon Direktur Utama atau Dirut PT Bank Sumut Freddy Hutabarat. Freddy terbukti melakukan penipuan sebesar Rp 275 juta terhadap seorang pengusaha bernama Ali Sutomo. T Oyong memvonis Freddy pidana penjara selama 2 bulan dengan masa percobaan 4 bulan. Namun sidang putusan dinilai ganjal. Pasalnya, T Oyong terkesan buru-buru dalam membacakan vonis mantan Manager klub bola, PSMS Medan itu. Bahkan bacaan putusan tersebut hanya berlangsung 3 menit.Menjatuhkan hukuman pidana penjara kepada terdakwa Freddy Hutabarat selama 2 bulan penjara dengan masa percobaan 4 bulan, kata Tengku Oyong dengan nada pelan.3. Kasus pembunuhan oleh Edy SuwantoPada 2021 lalu, T Oyong tercatat sebagai hakim yang menangani kasus pembunuhan dan penculikan oleh Edy Suwanto Sukandi atau Ko Ahwat Tango. Edy menjadi terdakwa atas penculikan dan pembunuhan terhadap pengusaha rental mobil Jefri Wijaya alias Asiong. Namun, T Oyong hanya menghukum Edy dengan pidana 5 bulan dan 3 hari penjara. Padahal, kasus tersebut merupakan kasus yang sangat berat dan berlapis, yakni pasal pembunuhan berencana sekaligus pasal perampasan kemerdekaan.4. Kasus Nyi Roro KidulHakim Oyong juga pernah menangani kasus seorang perempuan bernama Siska Sari W Maulidhina alias Siska yang mengaku keturunan Nyi Roro Kidul. Siska dituding melakukan penipuan terhadap anggota DPR RI Rudi Hartono Bangun berkedok titisan makhluk mitologis itu. Akibatnya, Rudi yang juga mantan kekasih Siska, merugi hingga Rp 4 miliar. Namun T Oyong memvonis lepas Nyi Roro Kidul palsu itu dari segala tuntutan.Padahal Jaksa menganggap Siska terbukti melakukan hal sebagaimana dakwaan jaksa penuntut umum (JPU) melanggar Pasal 378 Jo Pasal 55 ayat (1) ke 1 KUHP serta pencucian uang sebagaimana diatur dan diancam pidana dalam Pasal 3 UU RI No. 8 Tahun 2010. Jaksa menuntut Siska dengan pidana penjara 10 tahun dan denda Rp 2 miliar subsider enam bulan kurungan. Tapi Hakim Oyong menyebut tindakan Siska tidak termasuk ke dalam perbuatan pidana.5. Kasus perobek dan pembuang Al-Quran Doni Irawan MalayHakim Oyong pernah pula menangani kasus perobek dan pembuang Al-Quran Masjid Raya Al-Mashun Kota Medan, Doni Irawan Malay. Dalam kasus tersebut, T Oyong menjatuhkan vonis hukuman pidana selama tiga tahun penjara kepada Doni. Terdakwa terbukti bersalah dengan sengaja mengeluarkan perasaan atau melakukan perbuatan bersifat permusuhan, dan penodaan terhadap suatu agama yang dianut di Indonesia.

97,tempo,Perludem Dukung Banding KPU atas Putusan Penundaan Pemilu PN Jakarta Pusat,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2019/04/23/id_836436/836436_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698620/perludem-dukung-banding-kpu-atas-putusan-penundaan-pemilu-pn-jakarta-pusat,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Perkumpulan Pemilu untuk Demokrasi (Perludem) mendukung niat Komisi Pemilihan Umum atau KPU yang menyatakan banding terhadap putusan penundaan pemilu. Direktur Eksekutif Perludem Khoirunnisa Agustyati mengatakan hal itu menegaskan sikap KPU yang ingin pemilu 2024 tetap berjalan sebagaimana mestinya.Khoirunnisa menuturkan sejatinya putusan tersebut tidak bisa dijalankan oleh KPU. Sebab, menurut dia, putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut melanggar konstitusi.""Putusan ini kalau menurut saya tidak bisa dieksekusi karena tidak sesuai dengan konstitusi dan skema penegakan hukum pemilu kita,"" kata Khoirunnisa pada Sabtu 4 Maret 2023.Meski begitu, Khoirunnisa menilai KPU harus tetap mengajukan banding ke Pengadilan Tinggi. Ia mengatakan hal tersebut bisa jadi penegasan KPU menolak wacana perpanjangan masa jabatan pemerintah.""Tapi secara prosedur KPU bisa saja melakukan banding. Ini juga untuk menegaskan kepada publik bahwa KPU siap menyelenggarakan pemilu sesuai dengan jadwal,"" kata dia melalui pesan tertulis kepada Tempo.Selain itu, Khoirunnisa merasa ada kejanggalan dari Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat yang menerima pengajuan gugatan Partai Prima atas KPU. Sebab, ia menilai tidak ada kewenangan bagi Pengadilan Negeri menangani kasus sengketa pemilu. ""Kalau baca dari putusan ini keputusan KPU yang menyatakan bahwa Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat adalah perbuatan melawan hukum. Bisa juga karena hakim yang memeriksa ini tidak memiliki perspektif pemilu yang komperhesif. Karena memang bukan kompentensinya PN untuk menangani perkara soal pemilu,"" ujar dia.Khoirunnisa juga menyebut majelis hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat juga gagal memahami hukum di Indonesia. Sebab, kata dia, pelaksanaan pemilu tahun 2024 merupakan amanat dari UUD 1945.""Dalam pasal tertentu di UU Pemilu memang ada hal tertentu yang membolehkan pemilu ditunda. Namun, hal itu dibatasi oleh kondisi yang genting seperti bencana alam dan juga dilakukan di daerah yang terdampak saja bukan seluruh daerah,"" kata Khoirunnisa.Putusan PN Jakpus Bisa Menjadi Preseden BurukOleh ssebab itu, Khoirunnisa menilai putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat bisa menimbulkan preseden buruk ke depan. Sebab, menurut dia, bisa jadi orang-orang menganggap masalah sengketa pemilu sebagai ranah perdata dan bukan administrasi negara. ""Kalau ini dinormalisasi bisa jadi nanti ada orang kalah pemilu akan menuntut ganti rugi ke KPU. Padahal skema ini tidak ada,"" kata dia. Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat sebelumnya mengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU karena merasa dirugikan karena tidak lolos hasil administrasi Pemilu. ""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Sementara itu, KPU akan menempuh upaya hukum banding terhadap putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut.

Wakil Ketua MPR RI, Lestari Moerdijat, mengatakan, berbagai pusat pertumbuhan ekonomi di kawasan timur Indonesia harus terus direalisasikan.""Sektor pariwisata sebagai salah satu sektor yang potensial di kawasan itu diharapkan mampu menjadi akselerator pemerataan pembangunan,"" kata Lestari, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Pada ajang East Indonesia Investment Summit 2023 di Makassar, Sulawesi Selatan (Sulsel), Jumat, 3 Maret 2023, Menteri Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif Sandiaga Uno menargetkan investasi US$ 100 juta dari sektor pariwisata di kawasan timur Indonesia. Target itu berpotensi menciptakan 4,4 juta lapangan kerja baru.Sejumlah destinasi wisata super prioritas ada di Indonesia timur. Destinasi itu antara lain Likupang (Sulawesi Utara), Mandalika (NTB), dan Labuan Bajo (NTT).Menurut Lestari, dorongan untuk meningkatkan investasi di kawasan timur Indonesia selain untuk mengejar target sektor pariwisata nasional sekaligus untuk merealisasikan pemerataan pembangunan di tanah air.Apalagi, Rerie sapaan akrab Lestari melanjutkan, tren peningkatan aktivitas pariwisata mulai dirasakan. Catatan Kemenparekraf per Januari 2022 terdapat pertumbuhan perjalanan wisata global ke Indonesia sebesar 152 persen jika dibandingkan dengan capaian Januari 2021.Pada 2022 Jumlah wisatawan mancanegara yang datang ke Indonesia mencapai 5,47 juta orang dan tahun 2023 ditargetkan mampu mencapai 7,4 juta orang. Rerie yang juga anggota Komisi X DPR RI dari Dapil II Jawa Tengah itu, sangat berharap sejumlah target itu dapat dicapai lewat penguatan kolaborasi para pemangku kepentingan dari tingkat pusat hingga daerah serta masyarakat.Selain itu dukungan pihak swasta, menurut Anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai NasDem ini, juga sangat diperlukan dalam rangka memperkuat sektor pendukung seperti sarana transpotasi dan akomodasi.

""Kita tidak diam, kita harus berjuang,"" kata dia semangatHasto pun mengharapakan kalau saat ini, mekanisme demokrasi tahunan atau pemilu dapat terus dijalankan dengan tepat waktu. ""Pada tanggal 14 Februari 2024,"" ucap dia.Hasto Bilang Ada Manuver Besar Hasto mensinyalir ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024. Hasto menilai putusan tersebut melawan amanat konstitusi. ""Ada sesuatu kekuatan besar di balik peristiwa pengadilan PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut yang mencoba untuk menunda Pemilu 2024,"" kata Hasto. Menurut Hasto kekuatan besar itu mencoba memanfaatkan celah hukum sebagai upaya melakukan penundaan pemilu. ""Melakukan suatu gerak yang pada dasarnya inkonstitusional untuk menunda pemilu,"" ujar Hasto.Padahal, kata Hasto, Undang-Undangan Nomor 7 tahun 2017 tentang Pemilu telah jelas mengatur sengketa yang berkaitan dengan partai politik dan peserta pemilu hanya dilakukan oleh Bawaslu dan Pengadilan Tinggi Usaha Negara (PTUN). ""Karena Komisioner KPU adalah pejabat tata usaha negara,"" ucap Hasto.Sebelumnya, Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan KPU untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Putusan tersebut disampaikan pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan.Majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum.

Ia mengharapkan mekanisme demokrasi tahunan atau pemilu dapat terus dijalankan dengan tepat waktu. Hasto juga menyinyalir ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024. Putusan tersebut dinilai cacat hukum karena melampaui yuridiksi.

Menurut Ade, keputusan Hakim itu merupakan hasil dari gugatan Partai Prima yang seharusnya dihormati.""Itu kan hak hukum yang harus kita hormati. Lembaga peradilan ini harus kita hormati, saya hanya mengajak ketika ada orang berperkara masalah hukum, kenapa kita harus protes pada hasilnya? Kita jangan terlalu naif, kita harus hormati,"" ujar Ade dalam diskusi virtual, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Menurut Ade vonis majelis hakim pasti tak mungkin muncul secara tiba-tiba. Ia mengatakan pasti ada proses di pengadilan mulai dari pembacaan tuntutan, eksepsi, hingga bantahan dari kedua belah pihak yang berperkara. Semua proses tersebut, menurut Ade, luput dari pengawasan masyarakat.""Kita enggak tahu, kita tahunya di ujung aja. Ada putusan proses peradilan. Saya yakin semua di sini enggak mendengar tahapan persidangan yang ada di Pengadilan Negeri,"" kata Ade.Meski begitu, Ade menegaskan pihaknya tidak membela siapaun di perkara ini. Ia mengaku hanya ingin semua pihak menghormati proses hukum yang berjalan.""Kita harus hormati, saya bukan dalam konteks membela. Yang namanya hakim adalah wakil Tuhan, kalau kita marah-marah berarti kita marahi Tuhan. Kita harus hormati, terlepas dari nanti kekeliruan ada ini itu, ada forumnya lagi,"" kata Ade.PN Jakarta Pusat Perintahkan Tunda Pemilu 2024Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024.

Kami tidak ada bantuan karena yang ada hanya gagasan,"" kata Syahrul saat membuka rapat kerja nasional RPNN di komplek Pusat Pelatihan Manajemen Kepemimpinan (PPMK) Ciawi, Bogor, Jawa Barat, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Syahrul menjelaskan, Kredit Usaha Rakyat adalah program yang dicanangkan Presiden Jokowi dalam membantu petani mendapatkan akses perkreditan. Program ini menjangkau semua petani dari berbagai kalangan di seluruh Indonesia.Terutama kalangan petani milenial yang memiliki kemampuan dalam mengunakan teknologi digitalisasi. ""Saya katakan salah satu fasilitas yang diberikan Bapak Presiden itu adalah kredit usaha rakyat. Tentu aksesnya dengan pengawalan yang sangat ketat dan rasanya ini sangat berarti bagi teman-teman petani di seluruh Indonesia,"" ujarnya.Menurut Syahrul, pertanian adalah sektor yang sangat menjanjikan bagi semua kalangan yang mau berusaha dan bekerja keras. Pertanian juga menjadi sektor yang paling rentan terhadap gangguan dan krisis ekonomi.Dengan kata lain, Syahrul melanjutkan, pertanian memastikan rakyat tidak jatuh pada lubang kemiskinan. ""Kalau Bapak urus pertanian dengan baik pasti tidak miskin. Saya kira inilah saatnya kita membela bangsa dan negara. Posisi Kementan dengan RPNN harus menjadi yang dituju rakyat. Percayalah pertanian itu kokoh dan kuat,"" kata Syahrul.Ketua RPNN, Slamet, mengatakan organisasinya terdiri dari berbagai kalangan yang memiliki misi sama yaitu mewujudkan petani nelayan sejahtera. Slamet mengaku siap mendukung kesuksesan program yang dijalankan pemerintah.""Pertama kami siap melakukan pemberdayaan dan kedua kami siap bergerak bersama memperbaiki nasib petani agar tidak terpinggirkan.

Sekretaris Jenderal PSI Dea Tunggaesti mengatakan gugatan dan putusan penundaan pemilu tersebut salah alamat.PN Jakarta Pusat tidak berwenang untuk memerintahkan penundaan pemilu karena itu memang wewenang khusus yang hanya dimiliki oleh KPU dengan alasan tertentu seperti kejadian bencana alam, kata Dea pada Sabtu 4 Maret 2023.Oleh sebab itu, Dea menyebut PSI akan membela KPU banding hingga ke tingkat kasasi. Sebab, menurut dia, putusan majelis hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut bisa jadi preseden buruk demokrasi Indonesia ke depan.Keputusan ini menjadi contoh buruk bagaimana hakim bisa salah dalam memahami peraturan perundangan. Karena itu kita mendukung upaya KPU untuk banding,"" ujarnya melalui keterangan tertulis.Selain itu, Dea juga menyebut seharusnya Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta sedari awal menolak pengajuan gugatan Partai Prima. Sebab, ia mengatakan gugatan tersebut bukan merupakan ranah Pengadilan Negeri untuk mengadili.Dalam sengketa proses Pemilu yang berwenang adalah Badan Pengawas Pemilu dan Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara (PTUN). Jadi jelas bahwa gugatan dan putusan ini salah alamat, kata Dea.Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat sebelumnya mengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU karena merasa dirugikan karena tidak lolos hasil administrasi Pemilu. ""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Sementara itu, KPU akan menempuh upaya hukum banding terhadap putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut. Komisioner KPU Idham Holik menyatakan dengan tegas pihaknya menolak putusan PN Jakpus.KPU RI akan banding atas putusan PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut.

Deputi Pencegahan dan Monitoring KPK Pahala Nainggolan mengatakan pihaknya akan fokus terlebih dahulu mencari tindak pidana korupsinya terlebih dahulu.Meski begitu, Pahala mengtakan KPK tetap akan memperhatikan laporan yang dikeluarkan oleh Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi (PPATK) tersebut. Ia mengatakan KPK akan berkoordinasi dengan PPATK mengenai informasi tersebut.Belum, ini mau mencari pidana korupsinya terlebih dahulu baru ditambahkan dengan tindak pidana pencucian uang (TPPU). Ini KPK sedang fokus ke penerimaan gratifikasi atau suap, kata Pahala melalui pesan tertulis pada Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Selain itu, Pahala mengatakan KPK tidak bisa menindak apabila TPPU yang dilakukan oleh Rafael bukan berasal dari tindak pidana korupsi atau suap dan gratifikasi. Sebab, kata dia, kewenangan KPK terbatas kepada penindakan tindak pidana korupsi serta suap dan gratifikasi.Ya tidak lah. TPPU hasil kejahatan yang dicuci. Kejahatannya bisa narkoba, judi, dan lain sebagainya. KPK mengurus kalo kejahatannya korupsi, dari situ TPPU bisa ditindak oleh KPK, ujar dia melalui pesan tertulis.Selanjutnya, PPATK sebut keterlibatan jasa pencucian uang profesionalSebelumnya, PPATK menyebut ada dugaan Rafael Alun menggunakan jasa jaringan pencucian uang profesional dalam aktivitas transaksinya. Ketua PPATK, Ivan Yustiavandana, menyebut oleh sebab itu PPATK memblokir rekening seorang konsultan pajak dan beberapa pihak lain yang diduga ikut terlibat.""Kita mensinyalir adanya peran profesional money launderer yang selama ini berperan untuk RAT,"" ujar dia dalam keterangan pada Jum'at 3 Maret 2023.Meski begitu, Ivan enggan menjelaskan siapa saja pihak terkait yang diblokir, termasuk konsultan pajak tersebut. Ia juga belum menyebutkan berapa total nilai transaksi yang menjadi dugaan PPATK sebagai tindak pidana pencucian uang tersebut.""Signifikan, berkembang terus. Jumlahnya belum bisa disampaikan,"" ujar Ivan.Harta Rafael Alun disorot setelah kasus putranya mencuatHarta kekayaan Rafael Alun Trisambodo menjadi sorotan publik setelah kasus penganiayaan yang dilakukan anaknya, Mario Dandy Satriyo, mencuat. Mario menganiaya seorang anak berusia 17 tahun berinisial D hingga mengalami koma. Mario saat ini telah mendekam di dalam tahanan Polres Jakarta Selatan.Mario disebut kerap memamerkan harga kekayaan orang tuanya di media sosial. Diantaranya adalah mobil Jeep Rubicon dan motor gede Harley Davidson.Belakangan, Rafael menyatakan bahwa Jeep dan Harley yang dipamerkan Mario itu bukan miliknya. Mobil Jeep Rubicon tersebut juga diketahui atas nama seorang office boy di unit Inafis (Indonesia Automatic Fingerprint Identification System) Polri.PPATK kemudian menyatakan telah menemukan transaksi tak wajar dalam rekening Rafael Alun. Temuan itu bahkan disebut sudah dilaporkan ke aparat penegak hukum sejak 2012.Berdasarkan dokumen Laporan Harta Kekakayaan Penyelenggara Negara (LHKPN) KPK, Rafael memiliki harta berjumlah Rp 56 miliar. Hartanya itu paling banyak berupa properti yang nilainya ditaksir mencapai Rp 51 miliar.KPK menilai jumlah harta yang dimiliki Rafael mencurigakan. Sebab, sebagai pejabat Eselon III di lingkungan Direktorat Jenderal Pajak jumlah harta itu tidak sesuai dengan profil gajinya.KPK telah melakukan pemeriksaan terhadap Rafael Alun Trisambodo pada Rabu lalu, 1 Maret 2023.

Hal itu membuat budaya korupsi di Indonesia masih tinggi.Peneliti Pusat Kajian Antikorupsi Zaenur Rahman menyebut seharusnya penambahan harta kekayaan pejabat secara tidak wajar bisa menjadi peringatan adanya dugaan korupsi. Namun, kata dia, saat ini illicit enrichment masih dibiarkan terjadi di tengah pejabat Indonesia.Kalau dalam konsep tindak pidana korupsi penambahan secara tidak wajar itu kan illicit enrichment. Sampai sekarang illicit enrichment bukan merupakan pelanggaran hukum, kata Zaenur pada Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Oleh sebab itu, Zaenur menilai lemahnya pengawasan terhadap illicit enrichment memunculkan fenomena gaya hidup bermewah-mewahan para pejabat negara dan keluarganya. Padahal, kata dia, hal tersebut memicu seorang pejabat untuk melakukan pidana korupsi.Gaya hidup yang bermewah-mewah akan memunculkan kehausan validasi dari orang lain. Sehingga, gaya hidup tersebut memang menjadi salah satu faktor pendorong korupsi, ujarnya melalui keterangannya.Suara senada juga disampaikan oleh mantan Komisioner Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) Laode Muhammad Syarif. Ia menilai lemahnya pengawasan dan pencegahan korupsi para pejabat negara adalah karena hukum di Indonesia belum ada yang mengakomodasi illicit enrichment dan unexplained wealth.""Keduanya belum dianggap sebagai kejahatan. Jadi sulit merampas aset penjahat. Karena sampai sekarang belum ada Undang-undang Perampasan Aset,"" ujar Direktur Eksekutif Kemitraan tersebut pada kepada Tempo via pesan tertulis pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.KPK akui sulit melakukan penindakan terhadap pejabat yang memiliki kekayaan tak wajarKPK sempat mengakui masih kesulitan melakukan penindakan terhadap pejabat yang memiliki kekayaan tidak wajar. Wakil Ketua KPK Nawawi Pomolango menyebut Komisi terhambat karena belum adanya regulasi yang mengakomodasi penindakan terhadap kekayaan tidak wajar para pejabat negara.Sebenarnya itu wajib untuk diadopsi, kata Nawawi pada Kamis 2 Februari 2023 di kantornya, Gedung Merah Putih KPK. Jakarta.Harta Rafael Alun disorot setelah kasus putranya mencuatHarta kekayaan Rafael Alun Trisambodo menjadi sorotan publik setelah kasus penganiayaan yang dilakukan anaknya,Mario Dandy Satriyo, mencuat. Mario menganiaya seorang anak berusia 17 tahun berinisial D hingga mengalami koma. Mario saat ini telah mendekam di dalam tahanan Polres Jakarta Selatan.Mario disebut kerap memamerkan harga kekayaan orang tuanya di media sosial. Diantaranya adalah mobil Jeep Rubicon dan motor gede Harley Davidson.Belakangan, Rafael menyatakan bahwa Jeep dan Harley yang dipamerkan Mario itu bukan miliknya. Mobil Jeep Rubicon tersebut juga diketahui atas nama seorang office boy di unitInafis (Indonesia Automatic Fingerprint Identification System) Polri.PPATK kemudian menyatakan telah menemukan transaksi tak wajar dalam rekening Rafael Alun. Temuan itu bahkan disebut sudah dilaporkan ke aparat penegak hukum sejak 2012.Berdasarkan dokumen Laporan Harta Kekakayaan Penyelenggara Negara (LHKPN) KPK, Rafael memiliki harta berjumlah Rp 56 miliar. Hartanya itu paling banyak berupa properti yang nilainya ditaksir mencapai Rp 51 miliar.KPK menilai jumlah harta yang dimiliki Rafael mencurigakan. Sebab, sebagai pejabat Eselon III di lingkungan Direktorat Jenderal Pajak jumlah harta itu tidak sesuai dengan profil gajinya.KPK telah melakukan pemeriksaan terhadap Rafael Alun Trisambodo pada Rabu lalu, 1 Maret 2023. Dalam pemeriksaan itu, mantan pejabat Direktorat Jenderal Pajak Kementerian Keuangan itu mengaku tak melaporkan sejumlah harta kekayaannya kepada KPK.

Bahkan, dia menawarkan ide alternatif lain yaitu pemilu mendatang dimajukan pelaksanaannya.Partai Ummat menawarkan ide atau gagasan yang lebih dahsyat. Apa itu? jika bisa, pemilu 2024 dipercepat dari jadwal yang disusun KPU (Komisi Pemilihan Umum), kata Mustofa pada Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Mustofa menilai saat ini mayoritas masyarakat Indonesia ingin segera ada pergantian kepemimpinan. Sebab, menurut dia, agar adanya kepemimpinan nasional baru yang elegan yang dapat memimpin rakyat lebih baik.Coba deh, jadwal atau tahapan yang sudah disusun rapi itu bisa tidak dimampatkan. Diringkas waktunya dan semua agenda pemilu dibikin lebih dini pelaksanaannya, ujarnya dia melalui pesan tertulis.Meski begitu, Mustofa menyebut Partai Ummat mendukung penuh pemilu mendatang dilaksanakan sesuai jadwal yang telah ditetapkan oleh KPU. Ia memahami idenya tersebut sama saja melanggar konstitusi seperti halnya putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat.Apabila ide ini dianggap melanggar konstitusi atau dianggap merusak tahapan pemilu yang sudah ada, Partai Ummat menyarankan lebih baik pemilu dilaksanakan sesuai jadwal yang telah ditetapkan saja, kata Mustofa.Mustofa membeberkan mengapa Partai Ummat menolak keras putusan PN Jakarta Pusat yang menyatakan pemilu harus ditunda. Ia menyebut hal tersebut dapat mengganggu ekosistem kepemiluan yang tengah berlangsung saat ini.Pemilu itu melibatkan banyak elemen. Partai politik yang telah lolos verifikasi telah mempersiapkan dengan sedemikian rupa, pun KPU juga tengah menyiapkan perangkat yang diperlukan. Tolong jangan diabaikan begitu saja, ujarnya.Oleh sebab itu, Mustofa menilai putusan penundaan pemilu mendatang sebagai suatu keputusan yang konyol. Ia mengatakan Partai Ummat berharap kepada semua pihak untuk melawan putusan penundaan pemilu yang dikeluarkan oleh PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut.Jika ide gagasan mempercepat pemilu dari Partai Ummat dianggap nyeleneh, maka putusan penundaan pemilu Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat bisa dianggap menabrak kepentingan hajatan nasional seluruh rakyat Indonesia, ujar dia.PN Jakarta Pusat sebelumnyamengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU. Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan karena merasa dirugikan setelah dinyatakan tidak lolo verifikasi administrasi untuk menjadi peserta Pemilu 2024.

Kalaupun Anies sudah jadi keputusan politik NasDem ya kita hormati,"" ujarnya.Selanjutnya, Sandiaga sempat disebut akan hengkang ke PPPNama Sandiaga Uno memang sempat disebut-sebut sebagai salah satu calon potensial sebagai Cawapres.

Setuju?"" kata Mardiono di hadapan para kader PPP di Sulawesi Selatan pada 12 Februari 2023.Sandiaga Uno sendiri tak membantah dirinya akan pindah ke PPP. Dia menyatakan soal itu akan dibahas oleh Mardiono dengan Prabowo Subianto.""Nanti Pak Mardiono dan Pak Prabowo yang nanti akan bertemu,"" kata Sandi usai menghadiri Harlah 50 Tahun PPP bersama Prabowo di ICE BSD, Banten, Jumat, 17 Februari 2023. ""Saya hanya ikuti saja nanti pembicaraan level atas.""Anies Baswedan dan Sandiaga Uno pernah memenangkan Pilkada DKI Jakarta pada 2017.

Taj Yasin Maimoen.""Ini adalah atas perintah Bapak Presiden Jokowi untuk memastikan ketersediaan pangan menghadapi Ramadhan hingga Lebaran. Produktivitas bawang merah kita tahun ini cukup baik. Oleh karena itu, hari ini kita sama-sama mengirim bawang merah dari Brebes ke DKI Jakarta sebanyak 25 truk. Hari ini panen bersama Wamendag dan besok akan diterima Gubernur DKI Jakarta,"" kata Mentan SYL pada di Desa Krasak, Brebes.Data BPS menunjukkan luas panen dan produksi bawang merah nasional semakin meningkat dari tahun ke tahun. Di tahun 2018, luas panenya sebesar 156.779 ha dengan produksi 1,50 juta ton, 2019 seluas 159.195 ha dengan produksi 1,58 juta ton, 2020 seluas 186.900 ha dengan produksi 1,82 juta ton, 2021 seluas 194.575 ha dengan produksi 2,0 juta ton dan 2022 seluas 185.051 dengan produksi 1,99 juta ton.""Bawang Merah meskipun secara agregat tahunan kita terhitung swasembada, namun produksi antar-bulan dan antar-wilayah masih belum merata sepanjang tahun. Produksi bawang merah masih terkonsentrasi di beberapa daerah seperti Brebes, Nganjuk, Bima, Enrekang, Solok, Garut dan sentra-sentra lainnya. Di sinilah pentingnya sinergi dan kolaborasi dari berbagai stakeholder terkait, untuk menciptakan orkestra penyediaan pangan nasional, khususnya bawang merah, mulai dari hulu hingga hilir,"" tutur SYL.Ia melanjutkan, Kementan mempunyai mitra taktis dan strategis sebagai bagian dari upaya pengendalian inflasi nasional. Mitra ini disebut petani Champion, terdiri atas orang-orang terpilih yang dipandang mampu mengkonsolidasikan segenap sumber daya yang ada untuk mendukung upaya pemerintah dalam menjaga pasokan dan harga kebutuhan pangan pokok yang rentan terhadap inflasi, khususnya komoditas aneka cabai dan bawang merah.""Tahun 2023 ini, para Champion telah menyatakan komitmennya untuk mengkonsolidasikan pasokan bawang merah sebanyak 5.750 ton dan aneka cabai sebanyak 2.750 ton sebagai stok cadangan Kementerian Pertanian jika sewaktu-waktu diperlukan terutama pada momentum Hari Besar Keagamaan Nasional seperti Puasa, Lebaran, Idul Adha, Natal dan Tahun Baru,"" tutur SYL.Wamendag Jerry Sambuaga memberikan mengaparesiasi kepada SYL yang menyelenggarakan panen bawang merah dan berhasil meningkatkan produksinya, serta menjadikan neraca perdagangan tahun 2022 surplus Rp 54,46 miliar, tertinggi sepanjang sejarah Republik Indonesia. Dengan demikian, pemerintah dapat memastikan langsung ketersediaan stok pangan dan mengendalikan inflasi, khususnya menghadapi Ramadhan hingga Idul Fitri tahun 2023.""Salah satu tugas kita (Kemendag) melihat mengecek guna memastikan langsung ketersediaan pangan di daerah dan pasar, termasuk bawang merah. Kemarin saya keliling dari Samarinda, Garut, Sumatera Barat dan sampai ke Indonesia timur di Makassar, Gowa dan seterusnya memastikan harga-harga itu terkendali,"" ujarnya.Jerry menambahkan Kemendag terus mendukung agar ketersediaan pangan khususnya bawang merah ini aman dengan harga yang menguntungkan petani, pedagang dan masyarakat, salah satunya menyiapkan Sistem Resi Gudang (SRG). Sistem ini penting karena ketika panen raya tentu butuh penyimpanan, sehingga Kemendag juga ikut mendukung dengan membangun gudang di daerah-daerah sehingga hasil panen bisa disimpan aman dan terpelihara dengan baik dalam ruangan yang cukup lama yakni 3 sampai 6 bulan seperti bawang merah.""Ini salah satu bentuk bagaimana kita membangun bersinergi dengan Kementan sehingga hulu dan hilirnya terpelihara dan terjaga dengan baik. Oleh karena itu, kita harus menjaga sinergitas untuk kepentingan masyarakat,"" tuturnya.Sementara itu, Pj Bupati Brebes, Urip Sihabudin mengatakan kunjungan ini menjadi penting karena pemantauan ketersediaan bawang merah di kabupaten Brebes dilakukan langsung oleh Menteri Pertanian dan Wakil Menteri Perdagangan untuk mengamakan pasokan bawang merah menjelang Ramadan dan Hari Raya Idul Fitri 2023.Kabupaten Brebes memberikan dukungan penuh untuk stabilitas pasokan dan harga bawang merah nasional dengan kesiapan produksi lebih dari 15.000 ton bawang merah di bulan Maret untuk pemenuhan kebutuhan menjelang hari besar keagamaan nasional bulan Ramadhan dan Idul Fitri.""Luas panen dan produksi bawang merah Kabupaten Brebes menduduki urutan pertama di tingkat Provinsi Jawa Tengah maupun nasional. Di tahun 2022, luas panennya mencapai 32.573 ha dengan perkiraan produksi sebesar 384.448 ton menjadikan Kabupaten Brebes sebagai sentra nomor satu terbesar di Indonesia,"" ucapnya.""Mulai saat hingga Ramadhan dan Idul Fitri, kami siap menyuplai bawang merah ke Ibukota Jakarta sebanyak 25 sampai 27 ton per hari.

Menurut Adi, fenomena yang sering ditemui jelang pemiluini karena dua faktor.Faktor pertama karena rendahnya party identity yang dimiliki oleh politisi. Kondisi ini, kata Adi, yang menyebabkan berpindah partai dianggap jadi suatu hak yang biasa di konstelasi politik Indonesia.""Orang kita melihat politik itu, partai tidak lebih dari sekedar kendaraan politik bukan sebagai sebuah instrumen perjuangan ideologis untuk menegakkan dan memperjuangkan nilai-nilai politik tertentu,"" kata Adi saat dihubungi, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Adi berujar, karena parpol sering dianggap sebagai kendaraan yang dirental salam mobilisasi politik untuk maju dalam kontestasi baik itu pileg, pilpres atau pilkada, maka tak mengherankan mudahnya elit politik berganti partai politik.Faktor kedua, kata Adi, adalah penilaian parpol yang dianggap tidak menguntungkan elit secara politik. Sehingga dengan pertimbangan itu, menurut Adi, banyak politisi yang keluar partai mencari partai baru.""Mencari pelabuhan baru di partai politik baru yang bisa menampung aspirasi. Dan tentu saja yang paling penting memberikan akses terhadap hak politik yang seluas-luasnya,"" ucap Adi.Adi menyatakan pola politik yang ada pada politikus saat ini adalah untung dan rugi. Sehingga kalau partai lamanya sudah tidak menguntungkan secara politik, tidak kondusif secara politik, politisi bersangkutan pasti akan mencari pelabuhan partai politik baru.""Yang memberikan jaminan eksistensi baru dan jaminan kemenangan,"" katanyaAdi melihat proses perekrutan kader parpol merupakan hal yang tak bisa dianggap sepele. Menurut Adi untuk menghasilkan kader-kader berkualitas, proses rekrutmennya mesti berlangsung selektif. ""Kaderisasi dan rekrutmen politik harus ketat,"" kata dia.

Dalam pertemuan tersebut, menurut dia, Sri Mulyani menyatakan sedang merencanakan reformasi jilid II di Kementerian Keuangan. Menurut Laode pertemuan itu terjadi karena dia diminta memberikan masukan kepada Sri Mulyani agar reformasi jilid II di Kemenkeu berhasil. Reformasi yang dimaksud adalah ""bersih-bersih"" di Kemenkeu.""Bu Menteri mengatakan akan ada reformasi jilid II di Kemenkeu, khususnya di Direktorat Jenderal Pajak dan Direktorat Jenderal Bea Cukai,"" kata Laode pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023. Menkeu Sri Mulyani mengundang beberapa orang pada Jumat lalu, 3 Maret 2023, tersebut.Laode menjelaskan Sri Mulyani berencana memperketat pengawasan LHKPN para pegawai di Kemenkeu. Nantinya mekanisme pelaporan LHKPN pejabat Kemenkeu akan lebih dimutakhirkan.Fungsi dan kinerja Inspektorat Jenderal Kemenkeu khususnya dalam LHKPN seluruh pegawai juga akan ditingkatkan. Verifikasi akan lebih mendalam selain kepatuhan dalam menyetorkan dan melaporkan dokumen perpajakan.Direktur Eksekutif Kemitraan itu pun menyebut dalam reformasi jilid II Kemenkeu akan meminimalisasi penyalahgunaan wewenang. Menkeu Sri Mulyani berencana menyisir regulasi yang berpotensi menimbulkan konflik kepentingan pegawai Kemenkeu.Wakil Ketua KPK periode 2015-2019 itu memberikan sejumlah masukan kepada Sri Mulyani, antara lain meminta Ditjen Pajak melakukan penyidikan internal harta kekayaan para pegawainya yang dinilai tidak wajar.""Mereka pasti tidak membayar pajak harta yang disembunyikan atas nama orang lain,"" kata Laode. Inspektorat Jenderal Kemenkeu juga harus jeli terhadap keabsahan LHKPN pegawai Kemenkeu mengenai kewajaran perbandingan harta kekayaan dengan penghasilan pegawai.""Inspektorat Jenderal harus meperhatikan gaya hidup masing-masing pegawai.""Sri Mulyani membagikan pertemuan dengan sejumlah pegiat antikorupsi tadi via akun Instagram miliknya @smindrawati.Ada sepuluh orang yang diundang Sri Mulyani malam itu.

Menurut Feri, dalam Peraturan Mahkamah Agung Nomor 2 Tahun 2019 Pasal 10 dam Pasal 11 telah diatur yurisdiksi pengadilan negeri dalam penanganan perkara perbuatan melanggar hukum (PMH).Menurut aturan tersebut, jika ada pihak yang mengajukan perkara PMH ke Pengadilan Negeri, maka pengadilan negeri bakal melimpahkannya ke Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara (PTUN) karena bukan yurisdiksinya.""Jika pun Pengadilan Negeri sudah menjalankan perkara tersebut karena luput, khilaf, misalnya, maka harus diputus tidak dapat diterima,"" kata Feri dalam diskusi virtual, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Menurut Feri, aturan ini sudah ada dari tahun 2019 dan telah menjadi tradisi di pengadilan negeri untuk melimpahkan perkara PMH ke PTUN. Jika ada pemohon yang nekat mengajukan PMH ke Pengadilan Negeri, maka menurut Feri, Pengadilan Negeri bakal menolaknya.""Makanya aneh, tiba-tiba khusus untuk PMH ini diajukan di PN Jakarta Pusat, kemudian dijalankan bahkan diputuskan perkaranya. Jadi, ini sudah dilanggar,"" kata Feri.Dianggap langgar konstitusiSelain itu, Feri menyebut Majelis Hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat juga telah melanggar UUD Negara RI Tahun 1945 yang telah menyatakan pemilu dilaksanakan setiap lima tahun sekali. Dengan adanya UUD ini, maka vonis Pengadilan cacat karena melanggar konstitusi.Selain itu, Feri menyebut gugatan yang diajukan Partai Prima ke Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat mengenai gagalnya partai tersebut dalam proses verifikasi oleh KPU. Namun, ia heran keputusan Hakim justru menunda pemilu.""Kalau memang masalahnya soal verifikasi administrasi, kalau itu masalah keperdataannya perbaiki saja itu oleh putusan peradilan. Tapi, kok tiba-tiba meloncat ke masalah hukum publik, yaitu masalah tahapan penyelenggaraan pemilu jadi dari hukum privat perdata ke hukum publik, bagaimana ceritanya?"" kata Feri.Isi putusan PN JakpusPengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Perintah tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukan Partai Prima dengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Putusan tersebut dibacakan oleh Majelis Hakim pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023. Adapun Ketua Majelis Hakim yang menyidangkan gugatan tersebut adalah T. Oyong, dengan hakim anggota H. Bakri dan Dominggus Silaban.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum. Adapun perbuatan melawan hukum yang dimaksud adalah KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik calon peserta pemilu.Atas keputusan itu, Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan secara perdata ke PN Jakarta Pusat pada Desember 2022. Dan hasilnya, Majelis Hakim PN Jakarta Pusat mengabulkan gugatan tersebut dengan memerintahkan KPU menunda Pemilu 2024.Selain penundaan, pengadilan juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta.

Ada Paslon Puan Maharani- Andhika Perkasa dengan elektabilitas mencapai 2,1 persen. Lalu paslon Ganjar Pranowo-Sandiaga Salahudin Uno dengan elektabilitas 30,9 persen. Juga Paslon Prabowo Subianto-Muhaimin Iskandar elektabilitasnya 23,3 persen.Kemudian dalam simulasi dengan tiga pasangan capres-cawapres, Anies-AHY masih masih unggul dengan elektabilitasnya mencapai 37,3 persen.Dalam simulasi tersebut, Ganjar Pranowo- Airlangga Hartarto dengan elektabilitas 28 persen. Kemudian paslon Prabowo Subianto-Puan Maharani dengan elektabilitas 23, 4 persen.Pangi menyebut alasannya terdongkraknya eletabilitas pasangan Anies-AHY karena basis pemilih pada AHY relatif lebih menyebar jika dibandingakan dengan Khofifah salah satu kandidat cawapres.""Anies-AHY terjadi penguatan di DKI, Banten dan Jawa Barat sedangkan Anies-Khofifah hanya menguat di Jawa Timur,"" ungkapnya.Demokrat Inginkan AHY Jadi CawapresSekretaris Majelis Tinggi Partai Demokrat Andi Mallarangeng mengatakan sosok calon wakil presiden diserahkan sepenuhnya pada Anies Baswedan. Kendati demikian, Andi menyebut partainya sudah menyampaikan jika ingin menang, maka pasangan yang disodorkan pada 2024 hendaknya Anies bersama Ketua Umum Demokrat Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono alias AHY.Kalau kami Partai Demokrat, yang kami sampaikan adalah, kalau mau menang ya Anies-AHY, kata Andi di Kantor DPP Partai Demokrat, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023, Anies menyambangi Kantor Demokrat untuk berkenalan dengan jajaran Majelis Tinggi Partai. Andi menjelaskan, aspirasi majelis partai menginginkan bekas Gubernur DKI Jakarta itu berpasangan dengan AHY.Kendati demikian, Andi menyatakan keputusan soal cawapres ini tetap diserahkan kepada Anies.Itu aspirasi dari anggota-anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai. Tapi semua dikembalikan ke Pak Anies, kata dia.Sementara itu, Anies irit bicara kala ditanya ihwal sosok yang bakal mendampinginya pada Pilpres 2024.

Pokok masalah lemahnya sistem LHKPN di Indonesia adalah kelemahan hukum pemberantasan korupsi, terutama bidang unexplained wealth dan illicit enrichment""Keduanya belum dianggap sebagai kejahatan. Jadi sulit merampas aset penjahat. Karena sampai sekarang belum ada Undang-Undang Perampasan Aset,"" ujar Laode pada kepada Tempo pada Sabtu lalu, 4 Maret 2023, via pesan tertulis.Harta kekayaan pejabat negara, terutama di kemenkeu, menjadi sorotan publik setelah harta kejayaan pejabat pajak Rafael Alun Trisambodo terungkap di media. Menurut LHKPN dia memiliki harta kekayaan Rp 56 miliar yang dinilai tidak wajar karena dia pejabat Eselon III.Menurut Laode Muhammad Syarief, LHKPN belum ada sistem red flag yang otomatis menandai harta pejabat negara yang janggal. Maka sulit memetakan harta kekayaan pejabat yang mencurigakan. Kelemahan yang lain, Laode melanjutkan, adalah akibat minimnya personel yang mengelola LHKPN. Walhasil pengawasan terhadap LHKPN tidak maksimal.KPK pernah mengakui masih banyak celah mekanisme pelaporan LHKPN. Deputi Pencegahan dan Monitoring KPK Pahala Nainggolan pun menyebut belum ada sanksi tegas bagi pejabat yang memanipulasi pengisian LHKPN.""Sanksinya jangan hanya administratif,"" ucap Pahala di Gedung Merah Putih KPK, Jakarta, pada Rabu lalu, 1 Maret 2023. Pahala menilai hukuman bagi pelanggar LHKPN tidak efektif sebab tindaklanjut laporan pelanggaran wajib diserahkan kepada pemimpin instansi masing-masing.""Yang jadi masalah kalau pimpinannya juga tidak tertarik dengan LHKPN.""Wakil Ketua KPK Alexander Marwata juga menyebut sistem LHKPN saat ini belum sempurna. Salah satunya, LHKPN tidak mencakup kenaikan nilai harta sehingga seringkali harta kekayaan pejabat membengkak meski sejatinya tidak memiliki penambahan wujud materiil.Dia mencontohkan, pejabat beli tanah pada 2010 seharga Rp 1 miliar sehingga sekarang bisa menjadi Rp 5 miliar.

Ada Paslon Puan Maharani- Andhika Perkasa dengan elektabilitas mencapai 2,1 persen. Lalu paslon Ganjar Pranowo-Sandiaga Salahudin Uno dengan elektabilitas 30,9 persen. Juga Paslon Prabowo Subianto-Muhaimin Iskandar elektabilitasnya 23,3 persen.Kemudian dalam simulasi dengan tiga pasangan capres-cawapres, Anies-AHY masih masih unggul dengan elektabilitasnya mencapai 37,3 persen.Dalam simulasi tersebut, Ganjar Pranowo- Airlangga Hartarto dengan elektabilitas 28 persen. Kemudian paslon Prabowo Subianto-Puan Maharani dengan elektabilitas 23, 4 persen.Pangi menyebut alasannya terdongkraknya eletabilitas pasangan Anies-AHY karena basis pemilih pada AHY relatif lebih menyebar jika dibandingakan dengan Khofifah salah satu kandidat cawapres.""Anies-AHY terjadi penguatan di DKI, Banten dan Jawa Barat sedangkan Anies-Khofifah hanya menguat di Jawa Timur,"" ungkapnya.Demokrat Inginkan AHY Jadi CawapresSekretaris Majelis Tinggi Partai Demokrat Andi Mallarangeng mengatakan sosok calon wakil presiden diserahkan sepenuhnya pada Anies Baswedan. Kendati demikian, Andi menyebut partainya sudah menyampaikan jika ingin menang, maka pasangan yang disodorkan pada 2024 hendaknya Anies bersama Ketua Umum Demokrat Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono alias AHY.Kalau kami Partai Demokrat, yang kami sampaikan adalah, kalau mau menang ya Anies-AHY, kata Andi di Kantor DPP Partai Demokrat, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023, Anies menyambangi Kantor Demokrat untuk berkenalan dengan jajaran Majelis Tinggi Partai. Andi menjelaskan, aspirasi majelis partai menginginkan bekas Gubernur DKI Jakarta itu berpasangan dengan AHY.Kendati demikian, Andi menyatakan keputusan soal cawapres ini tetap diserahkan kepada Anies.Itu aspirasi dari anggota-anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai. Tapi semua dikembalikan ke Pak Anies, kata dia.Sementara itu, Anies irit bicara kala ditanya ihwal sosok yang bakal mendampinginya pada Pilpres 2024.

Bagaimanakah pendapat Mantan Hakim, Parpol, Aktivis, hingga Menkopolhukam soal Pemilu 2024 ditunda?Putusan PN Jakpus Pemilu 2024 DitundaKontroversi dimulai ketika Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan perdata terhadap KPU ke PN Jakarta Pusat setelah dinyatakan tak lolos sebagai peserta Pemilu 2024. PN Jakarta Pusat pun mengeluarkan putusan perkara tersebut pada Kamis kemarin, 2 Maret 2023.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim yang dipimpin T. Oyong, dengan hakim anggota H. Bakri dan Dominggus Silaban, memerintahkan KPU untuk menunda Pemilu 2024.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum karena menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat untuk menjadi peserta Pemilu 2024 dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi. Alhasil, Partai Prima tak bisa mengikuti verifikasi faktual.Selain penundaan Pemilu, majelis hakim juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta. Pengadilan juga menyatakan bahwa penggugat, yakni Partai Prima adalah partai politik yang dirugikan dalam verifikasi administrasi.Respons Berbagai TokohDisarikan dari Tempo.co, berikut pendapat berbagai tokoh mulai Hamdan Zoelva hingga Mahfud MD:1. Hamdan ZoelvaMantan Ketua Mahkamah Konstitusi (MK) Hamdan Zoelva mengaku kaget membaca putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat yang memerintahkan penundaan Pemilu 2024. Dalam akun Twitter-nya, Hamdan mempertanyakan kompetensi hakim dalam membuat putusan penundaan Pemilu tersebut,""Sangat kaget membaca berita hari ini, PN Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan KPU menunda pemilu 2024 selama 2 tahun 4 bulan 7 hari. Walaupun masih putusan tingkat PN yang masih bisa banding dan kasasi, tetapi perlu dipertanyakan pemahaman dan kompotensi hakim PN dalam memutuskan perkara tersebut. Jelas bisa salah faham atas objek gugatan"" tulis Hamdan melalui akun Twitternya, @hamdanzoelva, pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Eks Ketua MK itu menambahkan, seharusnya sengketa administrasi pemilu merupakan kewenangan Badan Pengawas Pemilu dan Peradilan Tata Usaha Negara. Sementara untuk sengketa hasil Pemilu merupakan kewenangan MK.2. Sejumlah ParpolPutusan kontroversial PN Jakpus ini tidak ketinggalan disorot oleh banyak Partai Politik atau Parpol. Salah satunya datang dari Partai Keadilan Sejahtera atau PKS.Politikus PKS Mardani Ali Sera mengatakan putusan itu tidak bisa menghalangi KPU melaksanakan tugasnya dan melanjutkan tahapan Pemilu hingga ditunaikan pada 14 Februari 2024.penyebabnya, menurut Mardani, gugatan Partai Prima adalah gugatan perbuatan melawan hukum alias PMH yang menyatakan partai pimpinan Agus Jabo Priyono ini dirugikan secara perdata. Namun, Mardani menyebut partai lain tidak merasa demikian.Selain itu, Mardani menyebut surat keputusan yang dikeluarkan KPU mestinya diperiksa dan diputus oleh Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara, alih-alih PN. Adapun keputusan ihwal Pemilu dilanjutkan atau ditunda, Mardani menyebut kewenangan ini berada di tangan Mahkamah Konstitusi.Selain itu ada juga Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan alias PDI-P yang juga menolak penundaan pemilu 2024.Melalui Sekretaris Jenderal PDIP Hasto Kristiyanto, Megawati mengatakan Mahkamah Konstitusi sudah menolak judicial review terhadap perpanjangan masa jabatan Presiden. Penundaan Pemilu, kata Mega, mestinya juga jadi rujukan.Tidak ketinggalan, Wakil Ketua Umum Partai NasDem Ahmad Ali menyebut keputusan itu kebablasan alias kelewat batas.Musababnya, kata dia, PN tidak punya kewenangan untuk mengadili perkara ini. Toh, jika Partai Prima merasa dirugikan, kata dia, maka mestinya keberatan diajukan kepada Badan Pengawas Pemilu atau Bawaslu.3. Mahfud MDMenko Polhukam Mahfud MD pun tidak tinggal diam perihal putusan PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut. Mahfud pun mengajak KPU mengajukan banding dan melawan habis-habisan secara hukum. ""Sebab secara logika hukum, KPU sudah pasti menang. Alasannya, PN tidak berwenang membuat vonis tersebut,"" kata Mahfud melalui akun Instagram resmi @mohmahfudmd, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Dari segi hukum, Mahfud menjelaskan, sengketa terkait proses, administrasi, dan hasil pemilu sudah diatur tersendiri dalam hukum. Ranahnya pun bukan di PN. Sengketa sebelum pencoblosanjika terkait proses admintrasimaka yang memutus harus Bawaslu. Namun jika menyangkut keputusan kepesertaan, paling jauh hanya bisa diguat ke PTUN.4. KPUKPU akan menempuh upaya banding terhadap putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat yang memerintahkan penundaan Pemilu 2024. Idham Holik menyatakan bahwa KPU menolak putusan PN Jakpus.""KPU RI akan banding atas putusan PN tersebut. KPU tegas menolak putusan PN tersebut dan ajukan banding kata Idham pada Kamis lalu.Dinilai Cacat HukumMantan Wakil Menteri Hukum dan HAM, Denny Indrayana, menilai keputusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024 cacat hukum.""Setiap putusan memang harus dihormati dalam artian jika putusannya tidak mengandung cacat hukum yang fatal dan menyebabkannya menjadi tidak dapat dilaksanakan alias non-executable. Putusan PN Jakarta Pusat jelas mengandung cacat hukum yang mendasar sehingga tidak dapat dilaksanakan,"" ujar Denny dalam keterangannya, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Denny menyebut kesalahan dan cacat mendasar yang dilakukan majelis hakim adalah memutuskan perkara yang bukan yurisdiksinya alias wilayah hukumnya. Mantan Guru Besar Hukum Tata Negara Universitas Gadjah Mada itu menyebut PN Jakarta Pusat menjatuhkan amar yang bukan kewenangannya.""Setiap pengadillan mempunyai wilayah kerja masing-masing, itu lah yang disebut dengan yurisdiksi, alias kompetensi peradilan. Tidak bisa perkara pidana, disidangkan dalam majelis hukum perdata. Tidak bisa perkara tata usaha negara disidangkan oleh peradilan umum,"" kata Denny.Alih-alih melalui Pengadilan Negeri, Denny Indrayana menyebut sengketa proses pemilu yang diajukan Partai Prima

Sekjen PDIP Sebut Manuver Gugatan Tunda Pemilu 2024 ke PN Jakpus Mesti DiselidikiSekretaris Jenderal PDIP Hasto Kristiyanto menyebut ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024. Dia mengatakan manuver itu harus diselidiki dari mana sumber kekuatannya.""Untuk itu, menghadapi manuver-manuver dengan kekuatan yang harus kita selidiki dari mana kekuatan itu, yang mencoba untuk menggunakan hukum sebagai alat yang akan merombak seluruh tatanan tatanan demokratis yang diamanatkan oleh konstitusi,"" kata Hasto saat memberi sambutan di acara PDIP di Taman Halaman Banteng, Jakarta, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Hasto menegaskan amanat konstitusi mengamanatkan bahwa pemilu hasil harus dijalankan setiap 5 tahun.Hasto mengatakan ini berkaitan dengan putusan PN Jakarta Pusat yang memerintahkan KPU menunda Pemilu 2024.

139,tempo,Arahan Menko Airlangga Jaga Inflasi dan Ketahanan Pangan,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/05/id_1186338/1186338_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698907/arahan-menko-airlangga-jaga-inflasi-dan-ketahanan-pangan,"INFO NASIONAL -- Menteri Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian Airlangga Hartarto mengatakan, pemerintah tetap waspada, antisipatif serta terus memperkuat ketahanan domestik dalam mencermati kondisi perekonomian global saat ini.Diketahui, pertumbuhan ekonomi global diproyeksikan oleh IMF akan melambat dari 3,4 persen pada tahun 2022 menjadi 2,9 persen pada tahun 2023.Penguatan ketahanan domestik dijalankan melalui bauran berbagai kebijakan fiskal dan moneter seperti Undang-Undang (UU) Pengembangan dan Penguatan Sektor Keuangan, Perpu Cipta Kerja, dan pengaturan Devisa Hasil Ekspor (DHE).Pemerintah juga terus menjaga daya beli masyarakat melalui pengendalian inflasi serta peningkatan investasi sebagai bagian dari strategi untuk mengakselerasi pertumbuhan ekonomi.Terkait dengan ketahanan sektor eksternal juga menjadi perhatian Pemerintah terutama untuk stabilitas nilai tukar rupiah sebagai bagian dari pengendalian inflasi terutama dari inflasi impor yang saat sekarang terutama dari harga-harga energi. Dalam hal ini tentu likuiditas menjadi penting. Dan sekali lagi, pemerintah dalam pengaturan devisa hasil ekspor sedang merevisi PP nomor 1 tahun 2019, kata Airlangga secara virtual dalam Kick Off Gerakan Nasional Pengendalian Inflasi Pangan (GNPIP) Tahun 2023, Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Sinergi dan koordinasi yang solid dari TPIP-TPID dalam mengendalikanVolatile Food (VF)di tengah peningkatanAdministered Prices (AP)juga telah menghasilkan capaian realisasi inflasi pada 2022 yang masih tercatat di bawah proyeksi yakni sebesar 5,51 persen Year on Year (YoY).Langkah berikutnya, Airlangga melanjutkan, melalui agenda GNPIP sejak tahun 2022 telah berjalan secara baik. Memperhatikan kondisi tersebut, pemerintah telah mengalokasikan anggaran ketahanan pangan sebesar Rp104,2 triliun dengan fokus program untuk penguatan sektor pertanian dan penguatan cadangan pangan. Program penguatan sektor pertanian antara lain untuk pengembangan budidaya pertanian, infrastruktur termasuk juga penyimpanan, subsidi pupuk, pemberian bunga kredit yang rendah, kemudian DAK fisik dan non fisik, serta dana desa terkait ketahanan pangan.Penguatan sektor pertanian juga dilakukan dengan kemudahan akses pembiayaan untuk peningkatan produksi pertanian seperti melalui program KUR Alat dan Mesin Pertanian (alsintan) dan KUR Super Mikro.Menko Airlangga mengingatkan bahwa dalam memasuki periode bulan Ramadan dan Idulfitri 2023 akan terjadi peningkatan harga pada pangan dan aneka tarif angkutan. Oleh karena itu, Pemerintah juga akan melakukan langkah-langkah antisipatif untuk mengendalikan inflasi selama bulan Ramadan dan Idulfitri 2023.Pertama, melakukan pemantauan harga kebutuhan bahan pokok seperti beras, minyak goreng, cabai, bawang, daging dan telur ayam ras, dan daging sapi. Pemerintah kemarin telah memutuskan bahwa Pemerintah akan memberikan bantuan beras selama 3 bulan. Demikian pula untuk bantuan telur dan ayam ini sedang diatur regulasinya. Akan diberikan untuk 3 bulan terutama kepada desil yang mendapatkan PKH dan bantuan pangan non tunai. Nah, ini diharapkan dalam 3 bulan ini bisa berjalan, tutur Menko Airlangga.Pemerintah dan Bank Indonesia melalui TPIP dan TPID juga akan terus mendorong sinergi dan kerja sama agar inflasi tetap dalam sasaran 2023 dan ini merupakan momentum untuk pemulihan ekonomi nasional. Inflasi yang terjaga diharapkan menjadi pondasi yang kuat untuk perekonomian di tahun 2023 dan 2024.Dan terakhir tentu dukungan dari para bankir dalam bentukmoral suasion.Dalam arti kebijakan yang ditetapkan oleh Gubernur Bank Indonesia untuk diterapkan di lapangan, agar pengelolaan ekspektasi masyarakat ini bisa terjaga.

Menurut Dominggus Oktavianus, pihaknya tak perlu digurui soal konstitusi.""Semua jalur yang kami tempuh adalah konstitusional. Dan persoalan hak sipil-politik itu adalah hak asasi yang dilindungi Konstitusi dan UU No.12/2005,"" katanya dalam pernyataan tertulis, Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Lanjut Dominggus menyebutkan, persoalan hak sipil politik itu merupakan hak asasi yang dilindungi konstitusi dan Undang-undang nomor 12 tahun 2005.""Justru KPU, yang terbukti melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum, dimulai dengan tidak mematuhi secara penuh Putusan Bawaslu hingga menghilangkan hak legal kami sehingga permohonan kami ditolak oleh PTUN,"" katanyaDominggus pun menyatakan kalau pendapat yang dilayangkan Hasto berkenaan dengan hasil putusan PN Jakpus merupakan bentuk superioritasnya terhadap partai Prima.""Pernyataan Bung menunjukkan perasaan superior Bung atas partai kami,"" ucapnyaBagi Dominggus, hakikat demokrasi adalah kedaulatan rakyat. Pemilu hanya salah satu mekanismenya.""Kalau mekanismenya dijalankan secara bobrok, oleh penyelenggara yang bermasalah, hasilnya akan bobrok. Kedaulatan rakyat tidak bisa tercipta atau terlaksana,"" katanyaSebelumnya, Hastomengkritik Partai Prima sebagai partai politik harus patuh terhadap konstitusi. Ia meminta tidak menggunakan celah hukum untuk menunda agenda Pemilu.""Termasuk partai politik termasuk partai PRIMA harusnya betul-betul berpolitik harus memahami hukum yang didasarkan dengan konstitusi kita yang mengatakan bahwa Pemilu dilaksanakan lima tahun,"" ujar Hasto saat memberi sambutan di acara PDIP di Taman Halaman Banteng, Jakarta, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Tidak lolosnya Partai Prima sebagai peserta Pemilu, kata Hasto, wajar syarat ketat diberlakukan. PDIP pun menyelesaikan langkah hukum yang ditempuh PRIMA. Ia menyebut ada ketidakpahaman PRIMA bahwa ada syarat dipenuhi menjadi peserta Pemilu.Selanjutnya: Dugaan adanya kekuatan besar..Selain itu, Hasto jugamenduga ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soalpenundaan Pemilu2024. Dia mengatakan manuver dalam gugatan Partai Prima harus diselidiki dari mana sumber kekuatannya.""Untuk itu, menghadapi manuver-manuver dengan kekuatan yang harus kita selidiki dari mana kekuatan itu, yang mencoba untuk menggunakan hukum sebagai alat yang akan merombak seluruh tatanan tatanan demokratis yang diamanatkan oleh konstitusi,"" kata Hasto.Hasto menegaskan amanat konstitusi mengamanatkan bahwa pemilu hasil harus dijalankan setiap 5 tahun.Hasto mengatakan ini berkaitan dengan putusan PN Jakarta Pusat yang memerintahkan KPU menunda Pemilu 2024. Putusan ini berkaitan dengan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU. Dia menyebutkan, keputusan tersebut merupakan keputusan yang melawan amanat konstitusi.""Ada sesuatu kekuatan besar di balik peristiwa pengadilan PM Jakarta Pusat tersebut yang mencoba untuk menunda Pemilu 2024,"" ujar Hasto. Dia mengatakan keputusan PN Jakpus itu sangat mengegerkan masyarakat Indonesia, dan menyebut tuntutan Partai Prima merupakan aksi sepihak.""Adanya aksi sepihak dari satu partai, yang kita pun belum begitu kenal yang namanya Partai Prima,"" kata Hasto.Hasto mengatakan Undang-Undangan Nomor 7 tahun 2017 tentang Pemilu telah jelas mengatur sengketa yang berkaitan dengan partai politik dan peserta pemilu hanya dilakukan oleh Bawaslu dan Pengadilan Tinggi Usaha Negara (PTUN).

""Namanya lebih kangen-kangenan dua sahabat lama,"" kata Willy di Nasdem Tower, Jakarta Pusat, Rabu, 1 Juni 2022.Willy mengatakan akan ada banyak hal yang dibahas keduanya. Termasuk, kemungkinan kerja sama antara dua partai. ""Kalau ada pembicaraan masalah koalisi, kerja sama politik, itu juga tidak menutup kemungkinan,"" kata dia.Willy berkata kerja sama politik itu tidak melulu tentang Pemilu 2024. Dia bilang kerja sama itu bisa juga dijalin di ranah DPR. ""Kerja sama ini spektrumnya luas,"" kata dia.Dia bilang masih terlalu dini NasDem dan Gerindra akan berkoalisi dalam Pemilu 2024. Dimulai makan siang hari ini, dia berharap silaturahmi antara kedua ketua umum dapat berlanjut. ""Saya pikir itu menjadi modal dasar politik Indonesia,"" tutur dia.Sekretaris Jenderal Partai NaDem Johnny G Plate mengatakan, pertemuan tersebut merupakan silaturahmi. ""Komunikasi yang intens dan cair di antara para pemimpin merupakan hal yang baik dan selayaknya menjadi contoh bagi para politisi dan warga pendukung Partai NasDem dan Gerindra,"" kata dia.Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika itu mengatakan Surya Paloh selalu mengedepankan politik Ahimsa, yaitu tidak mengajarkan kekerasan, memberikan perlindungan terhadap harga diri, dan rasa hormat pada sahabat.Saat ditanya apakah pertemuan itu bakal membahas kerja sama kedua partai, Plate mengatakan sekali lagi jika pertemuan tersebut hanya merupakan silaturahmi. ""Kursi pelaminan pasangan Capres 2024 akan segera diisi setelah Rakernas NasDem pada 15-16 Juni 2022,"" ujar Plate.2.

Dia mengatakan kompetisi dalam pemilihan juga tak boleh saling menjatuhkan.3. Tolak Politik IdentitasMenurut Surya Paloh, dia dan Prabowo sepakat jika mereka harus membangun kesadaran publik untuk menolak politik identitas, politik aliran, dan kelompok. ""Mas Prabowo dan saya ada kesepakatan dalam menghadapi pemilu kami bersama saling menjaga, menghormati dan salin mengingatkan kalau ada kekurangan, ujar dia.Prabowo dalam kesempatan yang sama mengatakan dirinya dan Paloh sama-sama memiliki tanggung jawab kepada partai.

Pertemuan akan berlangsung di kediaman Prabowo di Padepokan Garuda Yaksa, Hambalang, Kabupaten Bogor, Jawa Barat.Surya mengunjungi Prabowo sebagai balasan, setelah sebelumnya Menteri Pertahanan ini bertandang lebih dulu ke NasDem Tower pada Juni 2022. ""Benar,"" kata Ketua Bidang Media dan Komunikasi Publik NasDem Charles Meikyansah saat dihubungi, Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Tapi beberapa pengurus inti NasDem tidak akan datang menemani Paloh. Paloh akan datang salah satunya bersama Sekretaris Jenderal NasDem yang juga Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika Johnny Gerard Plate.Sementara Charles tak hadir karena berada di Makassar, Sulawesi Selatan. Wakil Ketua Umum NasDem Ahmad Ali, yang biasa mendampingi Paloh, juga tidak akan hadir di pertemuan ini. ""Saya lagi di Jepang,"" kata Ali.Sebelumnya, Surya lebih dulu mengundang Ketua Prabowo ke kantornya di NasDem Tower Menteng, Jakarta Pusat, Rabu 1 Juni 2022. Prabowo yang datang mengenakan batik warna cerah terlihat sumringah. ""Ya makan siang,"" kata dia saat tiba di NasDem Tower. Beberapa petinggi NasDem tampak menyambut kehadiran Prabowo.Menteri Pertahanan itu mengatakan tak ada agenda khusus dalam pertemuan tersebut. Tidak ada agenda khusus saya diundang kawan saya ya saya datang, oke,"" kata Prabowo.Berikut beberapa fakta yang telah diketahui seputar pertemuan kedua ketua umum partai itu.1. Belum Bahas KoalisiKetua DPP Partai NasDem Willy Aditya mengatakan pertemuan itu ajang silaturahmi. ""Namanya lebih kangen-kangenan dua sahabat lama,"" kata Willy di Nasdem Tower, Jakarta Pusat, Rabu, 1 Juni 2022.Willy mengatakan akan ada banyak hal yang dibahas keduanya. Termasuk, kemungkinan kerja sama antara dua partai. ""Kalau ada pembicaraan masalah koalisi, kerja sama politik, itu juga tidak menutup kemungkinan,"" kata dia.Willy berkata kerja sama politik itu tidak melulu tentang Pemilu 2024. Dia bilang kerja sama itu bisa juga dijalin di ranah DPR. ""Kerja sama ini spektrumnya luas,"" kata dia.Dia bilang masih terlalu dini NasDem dan Gerindra akan berkoalisi dalam Pemilu 2024. Dimulai makan siang hari ini, dia berharap silaturahmi antara kedua ketua umum dapat berlanjut. ""Saya pikir itu menjadi modal dasar politik Indonesia,"" tutur dia.Sekretaris Jenderal Partai NaDem Johnny G Plate mengatakan, pertemuan tersebut merupakan silaturahmi. ""Komunikasi yang intens dan cair di antara para pemimpin merupakan hal yang baik dan selayaknya menjadi contoh bagi para politisi dan warga pendukung Partai NasDem dan Gerindra,"" kata dia.Menteri Komunikasi dan Informatika itu mengatakan Surya Paloh selalu mengedepankan politik Ahimsa, yaitu tidak mengajarkan kekerasan, memberikan perlindungan terhadap harga diri, dan rasa hormat pada sahabat.Saat ditanya apakah pertemuan itu bakal membahas kerja sama kedua partai, Plate mengatakan sekali lagi jika pertemuan tersebut hanya merupakan silaturahmi. ""Kursi pelaminan pasangan Capres 2024 akan segera diisi setelah Rakernas NasDem pada 15-16 Juni 2022,"" ujar Plate.2. Sepakat Soal Stabilitas NasionalKetua Umum Partai NasDem Surya Paloh mengatakan pertemuannya dengan Prabowo mencapai kesepakatan untuk menjaga stabilitas nasional dalam Pemilihan Presiden 2024.Antara Gerindra dan Nasdem terjadi kesepakatan, stabilitas nasional harus kita jaga, kata Paloh di Nasdem Tower, Jakarta Pusat, Rabu, 1 Juni 2022.Paloh mengatakan kedua partai akan menghargai politik yang lebih sehat dalam gelaran Pemilu 2024. Dia mengatakan kompetisi dalam pemilihan juga tak boleh saling menjatuhkan.3. Tolak Politik IdentitasMenurut Surya Paloh, dia dan Prabowo sepakat jika mereka harus membangun kesadaran publik untuk menolak politik identitas, politik aliran, dan kelompok. ""Mas Prabowo dan saya ada kesepakatan dalam menghadapi pemilu kami bersama saling menjaga, menghormati dan salin mengingatkan kalau ada kekurangan, ujar dia.Prabowo dalam kesempatan yang sama mengatakan dirinya dan Paloh sama-sama memiliki tanggung jawab kepada partai. Namun, kata dia, mereka juga memiliki komitmen untuk menjaga keutuhan Indonesia.

141,tempo,"Hari ini di Tahun 1960 Presiden Soekarno Bubarkan DPR Hasil Pemilu 1955, Kenapa?",https://statik.tempo.co/data/0000/00/00/id_/_620.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698817/hari-ini-di-tahun-1960-presiden-soekarno-bubarkan-dpr-hasil-pemilu-1955-kenapa,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Hari ini tepat 5 Maret 1960 Presiden Soekarno membubarkan Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR) dan menggantinya dengan DPR-GR.Keputusan Presiden pertama Republik Indonesia ini bukan tanpa alasan, terdapat sejumlah sebab yang membuat Bung Karno membubarkan DPR hasil Pemilihan Umum (Pemilu) saat itu.Paska pembubaran DPR Itu bermula saat Bung Karno mengeluarkan Dekrit Presiden pada 5 Juli 1959 seperti dikutip dari Majalah Tempo 19 Mei 2008, dekrit ini merupakan keputusan Presiden Sukarno membubarkan lembaga tertinggi negara konstituante sebagai hasil Pemilu 1955. Pembubaran itu lantaran lembaga dianggap gagal menghasilkan konstitusi baru untuk menggantikan Undang-Undang Dasar Sementara (UUDS).Selain itu, tugas dan wewenang DPR sebagai hasil dari Pemilu 1955 ini sama dengan posisi DPRS secara keseluruhan, hal itu karena landasan hukum yang berlaku adalah UUDS 1950. Sehingga, melalui Dekrit Presiden pada 5 Juli 1959, Indonesia kembali pada UUD 1945. Jumlah anggota sebanyak 262 orang kembali diaktifkan setelah mengangkat sumpah. Di dalam tubuh DPR Pada saat itu terdapat 19 fraksi. Dari seluruhnya, didominasi oleh PNI, Partai Masyumi, NU, dan PKI. Pada masa ini, terdapat tiga kabinet, yaitu Kabinet Burhanuddin Harahap, Kabinet Ali Sastroamidjojo, dan Kabinet Djuanda.Lalu, dengan Peraturan Presiden (Perpres) Nomor 3 Tahun 1960, tepat pada 5 Maret 1960, Bung Karno membubarkan DPR dengan alasan DPR Hanya menyetujui 36 miliar rupiah APBN dari sebesar 44 miliar anggaran yang diajukan. Kemudian, setelah membubarkan DPR, tokoh proklamator itu mengeluarkan Perpres Nomor 4 Tahun 1960 Tentang Susunan DPR-Gotong Royong (DPR-GR).Mengutip laman DPR RI, DPR-GR memiliki anggota sebanyak 238 orang. Seluruhnya diangkat oleh presidengan dengan Keppres Nomor 156 Tahun 1960. Dalam menjalankan tugasnya, DPR-GR memiliki kewajiban untuk memberikan laporan kepada presiden pada waktu-waktu tertentu.Kewajiban tersebut termasuk menyimpang dari Pasal 5, pasal 20, dan pasal 21 UUD 1945. DPR-GR bentukan Presiden Sukarno ini bertahan selama kurang lebih lima tahun dan menghasilkan 117 UU dan 26 usul pernyataan pendapat.

Ia juga menilai peluang di sektor industri Farmasi terbuka lebar jika khususnya akibat implikasi Program Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) yang saat ini mencatat jumlah kepesertaan mencapai 248,7 juta jiwa dengan total pemanfaatan layanan kesehatan 502,8 juta kali di tahun 2022.Jika industri farmasi mampu berdaulat, cukup dengan internal market, kita bisa memaksimalkan konsumsi dalam negeri dengan banyaknya jumlah penduduk Indonesia yang telah menjadi peserta JKN. Artinya disini masih terus terbuka peluangnya dalam pasar industri. Kami berharap, pelaku industri farmasi senantiasa berkomitmen meningkatkan kompetensi dan menghasilkan produk farmasi yang bermutu sehingga upaya untuk menjamin kesehatan masyarakat indonesia dapat berjalan dengan optimal, terang Mahlil ketika memberi sambutan dalam Rapat Kerja Nasional dan Seminar Nasional Inter Profesi Farmasi dan Kesehatan di Indonesia, Federasi Serikat Pekerja Farmasi dan Kesehatan (FSP Farkes)  KSPSI di Surabaya, Sabtu (04/03).Mahlil menambahkan BPJS Kesehatan senantiasa berkomitmen agar Program Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional dapat berjalan dengan optimal dan terjaga keberlangsungannya. BPJS Kesehatan juga senantiasa berupaya meningkatkan mutu layanan kepada peserta dengan bersinergi dan berkolaborasi dengan berbagai pemangku kepentingan.Kami menyadari bahwa penyelenggaraan Program JKN dan upaya mewujudkan masyarakat Indonesia yang sehat dan sejahtera akan lebih optimal melalui sinergi dengan berbagai pihak dan pemangku kepentingan, termasuk dengan pelaku industri farmasi, terang Mahlil dalam kegiatan yang juga dihadiri oleh Wakil Menteri Ketenagakerjaan RI Afriansyah Noor di depan Anggota Wantimpres RI Soekarwo, Dewan Pengarah Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) Marsudi Wahyu Kisworo, Sekjen DPD KSPSI Bibit Gunawan, Ketua Umum FSP Farkes  KSPSI Agung Nugroho dan Kepala Dinas Ketenagakerjaan Provinsi Jawa Timur Himawan Estu Bagijo ini.Dalam kegiatan yang sama, Afriansyah menjelaskan salah satu fokus pembangunan Pemerintah Indonesia saat ini adalah Pembangunan Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM). Pengembangan kompetensi SDM adalah suatu hal yang tidak dapat ditawar lagi karena kompetensi dan daya saing merupakan langkah kuat yang harus dimiliki oleh tenaga kerja, termasuk didalamnya pada sektor farmasi kesehatan.Ia menambahkan bahwa Pandemi Covid-19 dapat terkendali dengan baik sehingga PPKM dapat dicabut pada bulan Desember 2022. Hal tersebut tidak lepas dari dukungan semua pihak, termasuk sektor farmasi dan kesehatan yang berkompeten sehingga dapat menjadi hulu tombak dalam memberikan pelayanan kesehatan.Dengan adanya sinergi melalui rapat kerja nasional ini diharapkan menjadi forum dialog yang memiliki jangkauan strategis, yang tidak hanya membahas komitmen namun juga membahas langkah bersama melakukan koordinasi dan evaluasi program serta pencapaian organisasi. Saya harap melalui kegiatan ini dapat menghasilkan rumusan-rumusan program yang lebih konstruktif yang disesuaikan dengan perkembangan ekonomi global dan diselaraskan dengan iklim investasi, terang Afriansyah.Sementara menurut Ketua Umum FSP Farkes  KSPSI Agung Nugroho, cita-cita mewujudkan sektor farmasi dan kesehatan adalah hal yang sangat penting dan mendesak untuk kepentingan bangsa Indonesia.

Dia menilai pertemuan tersebut sebagai bentuk kolaborasi lintas koalisi.Herzaky mengatakan Koalisi Perubahan yang digagas partainya bersama NasDem dan Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS), berupaya menjalin kolaborasi dengan koalisi lainnya. DIa menilai perbedaan cara pandangan dalam membangun bangsa ke depannya, dan berbeda pilihan koalisi hingga capresnya tak menghentikan kolaborasi tersebut.""Tetapi tetap jalin komunikasi dan silaturahmi. Apalagi sesama parpol di parlemen,"" kata Herzaky dalam keterangan tertulisnya, Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Soliditas parpol parlemen harus diperkuatDia mengatakan soliditas parpol yang berada di parlemen harus diperkuat. Apalagi saat ini, kata dia, konstelasi politik bangsa tengah menghadapi kekuatan di balik layar yang berupaya menunda pemilu.""Dari berupaya mengubah sistem proporsional terbuka menjadi tertutup, sampai berupaya menunda pemilu,"" kata dia.Herzaky menambahkan, setiap bakal capres yang diusung dari masing-masing koalisi merupakan sosok petarung. Mereka, menurut Herzaky,siap berlaga dalam kontestasi yang jujur dan adil menghadapi bacapres dari Koalisi Perubahan, Anies Baswedan.Dia pun meyakini setiap bacapres tersebut tidak akan ikut tergoda mengembalikan negeri ini ke masa kegelapan demokrasi seperti di Orde Baru.""Berupaya menunda pemilu 2024, ataupun malah mengembalikan ke pemilihan presiden melalui MPR,"" kata dia.Selanjutnya, AHY singgung soal kebhinekaan IndonesiaKetua Umum Partai Demokrat, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, turut menekankan pentingnya komunikasi dan silaturahmi lintas partai tersebut. Pasalnya, menurut dia, kebhinekaan merupakan hal yang tak bisa dipungkiri dalam kehidungan bangsa Indonesia.""Bangsa ini sejak awalnya dibangun atas kebersamaan berbagai suku, agama, ras, dan golongan yang berbeda-beda,"" kata AHY dalam keterangan tertulis yang sama.Alhasil, AHY berpendapat, kolaborasi antar elemen bangsa amatlah diperlukan untuk menghadapi tantangan global yang semakin hari semakin kompleks.""Ke depan, silaturahmi dan komunikasi seperti ini akan terus terjadi. Tidak ada hubungannya dan tidak akan mempengaruhi soliditas Koalisi Perubahan,"" ucapnya.Koalisi Perubahan dinilai paling progresifDi lain sisi kata AHY, Koalisi Perubahan terus bergerak maju, dimana saat ini sudah ada piagam deklarasi dan waktu deklarasi.""Menunggu momentum yang pas dan bagian dari strategi,"" kata AHY.AHY pun mengklaim kalau Koalisi Perubahan menjadi koalisi paling progresif. Diketahui sebagai koalisi pertama yang punya bacapres, dan tentunya gagasan koalisi yang jelas.""Koalisi pertama yang menyampaikan kepada publik gagasan perubahan dan perbaikan yang akan kami perjuangkan,"" ucapnya.Sebelumnya Prabowo Subianto menerima Surya Paloh di kediamannya di Hambalang, Bogor.

3622,tempo,Alasan Mahfud MD Ungkap Transaksi Mencurigakan Rp 300 T di Kemenkeu ke Publik,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/01/03/id_1170281/1170281_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1700397/alasan-mahfud-md-ungkap-transaksi-mencurigakan-rp-300-t-di-kemenkeu-ke-publik,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Menteri Koordinator Politik Hukum dan Keamanan (Menkopolhukam) Mahfud MD menjelaskan alasannya membuka informasi transaksi mencurigakan hingga Rp300 triliun di Kementerian Keuangan (Kemenkeu). Menurut Mahfud, saat ini informasi sensitif seperti itu tidak bisa lagi ditutup-tutupi dari masyarakat.""Kita tidak bisa menyembunyikan apapun kepada masyarakat sekarang ini, (kalau) tidak tahu dari saya, tahu dari orang lain,"" ujar Mahfud dalam keterangan video yang diunggah di akun YouTube Kemenko Polhukam RI, Kamis, 9 Maret 2023.Mahfud menerangkan, dirinya membuka transaksi mencurigakan di Kemenkeu ini ke publik lantaran wartawan menanyakan kepada dirinya. Sehingga, ia beramsumsi hal ini sudah diketahui oleh publik.""Tadi ada yang tanya, ya seperti Anda tanya, kok ada berita baru Rp500 miliar si Rafael? Lalu yang satunya juga tanya Rp300 triliun. Ya kita tidak boleh berbohong,"" kata Mahfud.Mahfud MD mengungkap temuan transaksi mencurigakan senilai Rp 300 triliun di Kementerian Keuangan di luar transaksi janggal Rp 500 miliar dari rekening eks pejabat Ditjen Pajak Rafael Alun Trisambodo dan keluarganya.Menurut Mahfud, temuan itu telah dilaporkan kepada Menteri Keuangan Sri Mulyani dan Kepala PPATK Ivan Yustiavandana. Ia menambahkan, KPK juga telah memeriksa satu per satu pegawai Kemenkeu yang diduga terkait tindak pidana pencucian uang.""Kemarin ada 69 orang dengan nilai hanya enggak sampai triliunan, (sekitar) ratusan miliar. Hari ini sudah ditemukan lagi kira-kira Rp300 triliun. Itu harus dilacak, dan saya sudah sampaikan ke Bu Sri Mulyani (Menkeu), PPATK juga sudah menyampaikan,"" Ketua Tim Pengendalian Tindak Pidana Pencucian Uang itu.Jamin temuan bukan hoaksMahfud menjamin bahwa temuan itu bukan hoaks dan tidak dapat disembunyikan di era keterbukaan informasi.""Kenapa saya bicara kepada saudara, karena kita kan tidak bisa sembunyi-sembunyi di era sekarang. Saya enggak ngomong, itu juga bisa bocor keluar. Maka saya sampaikan mendahului berita hoaks. Ini saya sampaikan tidak hoaks, ada datanya tertulis,"" kata Mahfud MD.Selanjutnya: Laporan mandek sejak 2009Mahfud MD menyebut laporan soal transaksi mencurigakan hingga Rp300 triliun di Kemenkeu sudah ada sejak tahun 2009. Namun, Mahfud menyebut Kemenkeu selaku penerima laporan tidak merespon hal tersebut.""Tapi sejak tahun 2009 karena laporan tidak di-update, informasi tidak diberi respon. Kadang kala respon itu muncul sesudah terjadi kasus, kaya yang Rafael. Rafael itu menjadi kasus setelah dibuka. Loh, ini sudah dilaporkan kok didiemin? Baru sekarang-sekarang,"" kata Mahfud.Mahfud menyebut laporan transaksi mencurigakan sejak tahun 2009 hingga 2023 itu ada sekitar 168 laporan dengan melibatkan 460 orang di Kementrian Keuangan. Namun, laporan itu mandek tak direspon hingga menunggu pihak lain seperti Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) bergerak mengusutnya.""Dulu Angin Prayitno sama, ndak ada yang tahu sampai ratusan miliar. Diungkap oleh KPK baru dibuka,"" kata Mahfud.Mahfud tak salahkan Sri MulyaniMahfud menyebut dirinya tidak menyalahkan Sri Mulyani atas menumpuknya laporan tak ditindaklanjuti tersebut. Menurut dia, kasus-kasus ini sudah dilaporkan hingga Menteri Keuangan sudah berganti empat kali.""Nah, itu karena kesibukan yang luar biasa sehingga perlu sistem aja menurut saya. Saya sangat hormat dan salut pada Bu Sri Mulyani yang begitu hebat untuk membersihkan itu, sudah lama mengambil tindakan-tindakan cepat,"" kata Mahfud.Selain itu, Mahfud menduga mandeknya laporan tersebut karena para Direktur Jenderal di Kemenkeu tidak melaporkan kepada atasannya soal dugaan transaksi mencurigakan tersebut. Mereka, kata Mahfud, mungkin menganggap transaksi mencurigakan itu sebagai kasus kecil dan tidak bermasalah.""Ternyata kalau dianggap ndak ada masalah, sekarang ada masalah.

Padahal, menurut dia, fenomena kekayaan tak wajar pejabat sudah menjadi rahasia umum terjadi di semua lembaga negara.Zaenur mengatakan kekhawatirannya tersebut berasal dari sikap pemerintah dan DPR yang dinilai tidak memiliki semangat pemberantasan korupsi. Salah satunya, menurut dia, adalah tidak segera disahkannya RUU Perampasan Aset yang mandeg selama bertahun-tahun.""Karena mungkin mereka takut ya kalau RUU Perampasan Aset ini disahkan, mereka bisa jadi menjadi korban pertama,"" kata Zaenur dalam keterangan tertulisnya pada Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Selain itu, Zaenur menilai tidak adanya UU Perampasan Aset juga akan semakin memberatkan kerja KPK dalam mengungkap harta kekayaan tidak wajar pejabat seperti Rafael Alun. Sebab, ia mengatakan KPK tidak bisa merampas aset tidak wajar kecuali harus melalui penindakan.""Ini juga tidak akan mudah. Ini akan sulit dilakukan. Karena harus mencari pidana apa yang pernah dilakukan,"" kata dia.Di sisi lain, Zaenur menyebut mencari bukti dugaan tindak pidana korupsi tidaklah mudah, terlebih untuk kasus Rafael Alun. Sebab, ia mengatakan kasus seperti Rafael Alun muncul bukan karena adanya dugaan korupsi.""Selama ini kan mencari barang bukti paling mudah melalui penyadapan. Sementara penyadapan tidak bisa digunakan untuk memproses perkara yang telah lalu. Jadi yang tersedia adalah penggalian alat-alat bukti yang masih tersisa,"" kata Zaenur. Oleh sebab itu, Zaenur menilai penyadapan bisa menjadi game changer pemberantasan korupsi di tanah air. ""Lantas ke depan hanya dengan RUU Perampasan Aset inilah yang kita harapkan,"" ujar dia.Suara senada juga diberikan oleh mantan Komisioner KPK Laode Muhammad Syarif. Ia menyebut Indonesia saat ini masih membiarkan fenomena unexplained wealth dan illicit enrichment terjadi karena belum ada sistem yang mengakomodasi hal tersebut.""Keduanya belum dianggap sebagai kejahatan. Jadi sulit merampas aset penjahat. Karena sampai sekarang belum ada Undang-Undang Perampasan Aset,"" ujar Laode pada kepada Tempo pada Sabtu lalu, 4 Maret 2023, via pesan tertulis.Harta kekayaan pejabat negara, terutama di kemenkeu, menjadi sorotan publik setelah harta kekayaan pejabat pajak Rafael Alun Trisambodo terungkap di media. Menurut LHKPN dia memiliki harta kekayaan Rp 56 miliar.Menurut Laode, sistem dan mekanisme LHKPN juga harus terus ditingkatkan dan diperbaiki. Ia mengatakan salah satu permasalahan LHKPN adalah tidak adanya pemetaan kekayaan pejabat yang tidak wajar.""LHKPN harus dilengkapi dengan red flagotomatis. Harus ada pemetaan orang dan pejabat yang dianggap rentan.

Mereka menargetkan proses identifikasi jenazah tersebut bisa selesai pada pekan ini.Meski begitu, Kepala Biro Kedokteran Kepolisian Pusdokkes Polri Brigjen Nyoman Eddy Purnama mengatakan, mereka tidak ingin terburu-buru. Ia menyebut kepolisian mengutamakan akurasi dan ketepatan daripada kecepatan.""Yang penting kita bekerja dengan teliti, bukan kecepatan. DNA ini kan ada step-step nya. Tapi kita upayakan semaksimal mungkin dalam waktu 4 hari sampai seminggu ini,"" kata Nyoman pada Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Nyoman mengatakan dari 15 jenazah yang sudah diterima pihaknya, sekitar sembilan jenazah masih bagus untuk dilakukan pemeriksaan. Ia menyebut hal tersebut akan mempermudah proses identifikasi jenazah.""Sementara itu, enam lainnya yang kita terima sudah dalam keadaan hangus. Untuk pemeriksaan luar akan susah, jadi kita ambil DNA-nya saja,"" kata Nyoman saat ditemui di RS Polri Keramat Jati, Jakarta.Selain itu, Nyoman menambahkan proses identifikasi melalui DNA tersebut biasanya berselang antara empat hari hingga satu pekan. Ia mengatakan saat ini proses identifikasi DNA tersebut masih terus berlangsung.""Kemarin, kami sudah ambil sampel hari Sabtu. At least 4 hari mudah-mudahan bisa kita percepat. Biasanya seminggu,"" kata Nyoman.Kepala Disaster Victim Identification Mabes Polri Komisaris Besar Ahmad Fauzi mengatakan, proses identifikasi tersebut akan cukup memakan waktu lama. Sebab, kata dia, Polri tidak ingin ada kesalahan identifikasi sehingga salah memberikan jenazah korban kepada yang bukan keluarganya.""Kalau kita salah menyerahkan kepada orang lain kan enggak bisa. Kita bukannya membuat lama, tapi memastikan, jangan sampai kita salah menyerahkan,"" kata dia.Hingga saat ini, Polri telah berhasil menemukan 15 jenazah korban kebakaran Depo Pertamina Pelumpang. Dari 15 jenazah tersebut, tiga diantaranya telah berhasil diidentifikasi.Kebakaran Depo Pertamina Pelumpang, Koja, Jakarta Utara terjadi pada Jum'at malam 3 Maret 2023. Warga mengaku sempat mencium bau bahan bakar sejak beberapa jam sebelumnya.Mereka juga mendengar ledakan setelah sambaran petir terjadi.

Namun, dalam pertemuan tersebut ditekankan bahwa keduanya merupakan sahabat yang sudah terjalin puluhan tahun. Artinya, meski berbeda dalam urusan Capres, mereka sepakat menjaga situasi di Pilpres 2024 nanti tetap kondusif.""Terpenting bangsa ini rukun, bersatu dan damai. Kami sepakat menghormati keputusan politik masing-masing partai,"" ujar dia.Menurut Prabowo, dalam pertemuan itu mereka juga sepakat kondisi bangsa dan negara harus tetap damai. ""Tidak boleh takut oposisi, selama masih NKRI, Pancasila dan Bhineka Tunggal Ika,"" kata Prabowo.Surya Paloh pun mengamini apa yang dikatakan oleh Prabowo. Menurut bos Media Grup itu, meski NasDem mengusung Anies Baswedan sebagai calon presiden dan Gerindra mengusung Prabowo, mereka tetap sepakat kondisi Pemilu 2024 tetap berlangsung dengan damai.Paloh pun menyebut persahabatannya dengan Prabowo yang telah berlangsung puluhan tahun serta melalui kondisi suka dan duka bersama.""Betul kata mas Bowo, kita berteman sudah 40 tahun. Kita sepakat, meski beda capres tapi dalam Pilpres mendatang harus lebih rukun damai dan aman.

118,tempo,Jokowi Akui Buffer Zone Depo Pertamina Plumpang Dibahas saat Jadi Gubernur DKI,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/05/id_1186253/1186253_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698777/jokowi-akui-buffer-zone-depo-pertamina-plumpang-dibahas-saat-jadi-gubernur-dki,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi merespons pernyataan Penjabat Gubernur DKI Jakarta Heru Budi Hartono yang menyebut Pemerintah DKI Jakarta sudah mengusulkan pembuatan buffer zone antara Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, dan rumah-rumah warga ke PT Pertamina (Persero) sejak 2009. Artinya, usulan sudah disampaikan jauh sebelum Jokowi jadi Gubernur DKI Jakarta.Jokowi tidak membantah bila rencana tersebut juga disiapkan di era pemerintah DKI sebelumnya, termasuk di masa dia memimpin di Jakarta, dari 2012 sampai 2014. ""Dulu memang sudah direncanakan untuk dibuat air di kanan kirinya sungai,"" kata Jokowi saat ditemui mengunjungi para pengungsi kebakaran Depo Pertamina di RPTRA Rasela, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Ahad 5 Maret 2023.""Tetapi memang belum sampai kepada titik mencarikan solusi kepada penduduknya yang ada di situ,"" kata Jokowi.Kepala negara mengakui area Tanah Merah atau Jalan Tanah Merah Bawah yang jadi lokasi kebakaran merupakan pemukiman padat dan penuh penduduk. ""Semuanya harus dicarikan solusi. Saya kira keamanan masyarakat, keselamatan masyarakat harus menjadi titik yang utama,"" kata dia.Jokowi menyebut seharusnya zona ini harusnya menjadi zona air, seperti misalnya dibuat sungai yang memisahkan Depo dan pemukiman. Tujuannya untuk melindungi objek vital yang ada di dalam Depo.""Karena barang-barang didalamnya barang-barang yang sangat bahaya untuk berdekatan dengan masyarakat, apalagi dengan pemukiman penduduk,"" kata Jokowi.Usulan Buffer Zone Sejak 2009Sebelumnya, kebakaran terjadi di Depo Pertamina pada Jumat malam, pukul 20.11 WIB, 3 Maret 2023. Usulan soal buffer zone ini diungkit Heru saat mengunjungi lokasi kebakaran pada Jumat malam tersebut.Heru menyebut tahun 2009, pemerintah daerah sudah mengusulkan buffer zone selebar 50 meter. ""Kira-kira begitu, kami kembalikan ke Pertamina,"" kata Heru usai menggelar rapat darurat di Pos Koramil Koja, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu dini hari, 4 Maret 2023.Sekretaris Daerah DKI Jakarta Joko Agus Setyono mengatakan Pemerintah Provinsi akan berkerja sama dengan PT Pertamina untuk melanjutkan rencana pembuatan buffer zone di kawasan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara.""Kita bikin kerja sama, lah, sama Pertamina,"" kata Joko kepada wartawan di Koramil Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Namun, eks Kepala BPK Bali itu belum merinci soal pembuatan buffer zone ini. ""Ya, pastinya, semuanya itu, upaya-upaya untuk mengarah yang lebih bagus,"" ujarnya.Selanjutnya: IMB Anies DisorotUsai kebakaran, masalah status lahan dan bangunan warga pun jadi sorotan. Anggota Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPRD DKI Jakarta Gilbert Simanjuntak menyatakan sepatutnya mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan ikut bertanggungjawab atas kebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat malam lalu.Menurut Gilbert, sejak awal sudah diketahui bahwa lahan di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang tidak boleh ada permukiman dalam jarak tertentu. Lahan yang terkena kebakaran tadi adalah milik PT Pertamina.""Lahan milik PT Pertamina ditempati warga akan tetapi oleh Anies sewaktu menjabat Gubernur diberi IMB, yang jelas bertentangan dengan peraturan,"" ujar Gilbert dalam keterangannya pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Gilbert menilai IMB yang dikeluarkan Anies Baswedan saat menjabat Gubernur DKI membuat persoalan semakin rumit. Menurut dia, saat itu Anies terkesan lebih mementingkan pemenuhan janji kampanye walau harus menabrak aturan. ""Kesalahan itu tidak sepatutnya berulang.""Berkaca dari kejadian tersebut, Gilbert penduduk di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang dipindahkan agar tidak menjadi korban lagi.Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan menerbitkan IMB (Izin Mendirikan Bangunan) Sementara kepada penduduk Kampung Tanah Merah pada Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.""Ini adalah jalan tengah yang kami ambil untuk menyelesaikan masalah bangunan-bangunan yang berada di tanah yang status legalnya belum tuntas. Tapi mereka faktanya ada di tempat ini sudah puluhan tahun,"" kata Anies Baswedan di Kampung Tanah Merah, Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.Pertamina enggan berkomentar lebih lanjut ketika ditanya mengenai

Termasuk di era kepemimpinannya di DKI Jakarta pada 2012-2014.""Dulu memang sudah direncanakan untuk dibuat air di kanan kirinya sungai, tetapi memang belum sampai kepada titik mencarikan solusi kepada penduduknya yang ada di situ,"" kata Jokowi saat ditemui mengunjungi para pengungsi kebakaran Depo Pertamina di RPTRA Rasela, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Ahad 5 Maret 2023.""Tanah merah-nya ini kan padat dan penuh. Semuanya harus dicarikan solusi. Saya kira keamanan masyarakat, keselamatan masyarakat harus menjadi titik yang utama,"" kata dia. Tanah Merah mengacu pada Jalan Tanah Merah Bawah yang jadi lokasi kebakaran.Jokowi menyebut seharusnya zona ini harusnya menjadi zona air, seperti misalnya dibuat sungai yang memisahkan Depo dan pemukiman. Tujuannya untuk melindungi objek vital yang ada di dalam Depo. ""Karena barang-barang didalamnya barang-barang yang sangat bahaya untuk berdekatan dengan masyarakat, apalagi dengan pemukiman penduduk,"" kata dia.Buffer zone diungkit HeruSebelumnya, kebakaran terjadi di Depo Pertamina pada Jumat malam, pukul 20.11 WIB, 3 Maret 2023. Usulan soal buffer zone ini diungkit Heru saat mengunjungi lokasi kebakaran pada Jumat malam tersebut.Heru menyebut tahun 2009, pemerintah daerah sudah mengusulkan buffer zone selebar 50 meter. ""Kira-kira begitu, kami kembalikan ke Pertamina,"" kata Heru usai menggelar rapat darurat di Pos Koramil Koja, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu dini hari, 4 Maret 2023.Sekretaris Daerah DKI Jakarta Joko Agus Setyono mengatakan Pemerintah Provinsi akan berkerja sama dengan PT Pertamina untuk melanjutkan rencana pembuatan buffer zone di kawasan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara.""Kita bikin kerja sama, lah, sama Pertamina,"" kata Joko kepada wartawan di Koramil Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Namun, eks Kepala BPK Bali itu belum merinci soal pembuatan buffer zone ini. ""Ya, pastinya, semuanya itu, upaya-upaya untuk mengarah yang lebih bagus,"" ujarnya.IMB Anies disorotUsai kebakaran, masalah status lahan dan bangunan warga pun jadi sorotan. Anggota Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPRD DKI Jakarta Gilbert Simanjuntak menyatakan sepatutnya mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan ikut bertanggungjawab atas kebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat malam lalu.Menurut Gilbert, sejak awal sudah diketahui bahwa lahan di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang tidak boleh ada permukiman dalam jarak tertentu. Lahan yang terkena kebakaran tadi adalah milik PT Pertamina.""Lahan milik PT Pertamina ditempati warga akan tetapi oleh Anies sewaktu menjabat Gubernur diberi IMB, yang jelas bertentangan dengan peraturan,"" ujar Gilbert dalam keterangannya pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Gilbert menilai IMB yang dikeluarkan Anies Baswedan saat menjabat Gubernur DKI membuat persoalan semakin rumit. Menurut dia, saat itu Anies terkesan lebih mementingkan pemenuhan janji kampanye walau harus menabrak aturan. ""Kesalahan itu tidak sepatutnya berulang.""Berkaca dari kejadian tersebut, Gilbert penduduk di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang dipindahkan agar tidak menjadi korban lagi.Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan menerbitkan IMB (Izin Mendirikan Bangunan) Sementara kepada penduduk Kampung Tanah Merah pada Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.""Ini adalah jalan tengah yang kami ambil untuk menyelesaikan masalah bangunan-bangunan yang berada di tanah yang status legalnya belum tuntas. Tapi mereka faktanya ada di tempat ini sudah puluhan tahun,"" kata Anies Baswedan di Kampung Tanah Merah, Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.Pertamina enggan berkomentar lebih lanjut ketika ditanya mengenai

3626,cnbcindonesia,Aturan Berubah! Pasang PLTA Atap Tak Bisa Jual Listrik ke PLN,https://akcdn.detik.net.id/visual/2021/11/26/plts-doc-pertamina-nre_169.jpeg?w=360&q=90,https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/news/20230309094507-4-420168/aturan-berubah-pasang-plta-atap-tak-bisa-jual-listrik-ke-pln,"Jakarta, CNBC Indonesia - Pemerintah dalam hal ini Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) sedang mengubah Peraturan Menteri (Permen) ESDM No.26 tahun 2021 tentang Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Surya (PLTS) Atap yang Terhubung Pada Jaringan Tenaga Listrik Pemegang Izin Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik untuk Kepentingan Umum. Dalam revisi beleid itu tersebut, nantinya pemakaian listrik dari Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Surya (PLTS) Atap hanya bisa dimanfaatkan untuk kepentingan sendiri. Artinya, listrik yang dihasilkan oleh masyarakat dari PLTS Atap tidak bisa dijual kepada PT PLN (Persero). Direktur Aneka Energi Baru dan Energi Terbarukan Direktorat Jenderal Energi Baru Terbarukan dan Konservasi Energi (EBTKE) Kementerian ESDM Andriah Feby Misna mengatakan, nantinya masyarakat bisa memproduksi listrik melalui PLTS Atap, namun harus dikonsumsi sendiri sesuai dengan kebutuhan. ""Revisinya masih berjalan. Iya sementara demikian, yang dipasang untuk dikonsumsi sendiri,"" ungkapnya kepada CNBC Indonesia, dikutip Kamis (9/3/2023). Lantas, apa alasan aturan ini diubah? Kenapa pengguna PLTS Atap tak bisa menjual listriknya ke PLN? Feby mengatakan, ini dilakukan karena kondisi kelebihan pasokan listrik pada jaringan listrik PT PLN (Persero). ""PLN sedang oversupply (listrik),"" ucapnya. Sebelumnya, Feby saat ditemui di Kantor Kementerian ESDM, Jakarta, Rabu (1/3/2023) mendorong kepada masyarakat, baik pribadi maupun industri, agar memasang pembangkit listrik sesuai dengan kebutuhan. Dengan demikian, nantinya listrik yang dihasilkan tersebut harus dikonsumsi sendiri. ""Jadi nanti kita juga mendorong agar industri itu memasang sesuai dengan kebutuhannya. Jadi tidak akan diekspor, yang dipasang itu adalah mereka pakai sendiri,"" tambahnya. Seperti diketahui, Peraturan Menteri ESDM No.26/2021 tentang Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Surya Atap yang Terhubung Pada Jaringan Tenaga Listrik Pemegang Izin Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik untuk Kepentingan Umum itu, sejatinya berlaku sejak 20 Agustus 2021.\ Namun peraturan ini belum dijalankan karena pemerintah masih menghitung seberapa besar pengaruhnya terhadap sistem pasokan listrik yang ada di PLN. Adapun substansi pokok dari Permen ESDM Nomor 26 Tahun 2021 yaitu: 1. Ketentuan ekspor kWh listrik ditingkatkan dari 65% menjadi 100%; 2. Kelebihan akumulasi selisih tagihan dinihilkan, diperpanjang dari 3 bulan menjadi 6 bulan; 3. Jangka waktu permohonan PLTS Atap menjadi lebih singkat (5 hari tanpa penyesuaian Perjanjian Jual Beli Listrik (PJBL) dan 12 hari dengan adanya penyesuaian PJBL); 4. Mekanisme pelayanan berbasis aplikasi untuk kemudahan penyampaian permohonan, pelaporan, dan pengawasan program PLTS Atap; 5. Dibukanya peluang perdagangan karbon dari PLTS Atap; 6.

Hal itu dikabarkan langsung oleh pemerintah dalam hal ini Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) serta Satuan Kerja Khusus Pelaksana Kegiatan Usaha Hulu Minyak dan Gas Bumi (SKK Migas). Adapun 'harta karun' migas raksasa itu ditemukan di dua wilayah timur Indonesia, yakni di Blok Warim, Papua dan Blok Seram, Maluku. Jika memang benar-benar terbukti, tentunya penemuan 'harta karun' migas ini bisa mendukung rencana target produksi migas Indonesia yang mencapai 1 juta barel.  Berdasarkan bahan paparan Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM), Blok Seram disebut memiliki potensi 'harta karun' minyak sebesar 7,596 miliar barel dan gas sebesar 13,69 triliun kaki kubik (TCF). Sementara area Warim menyimpan potensi minyak 25,968 miliar barel dan gas bumi 47,37 TCF. ""Jadi di Warim itu potensi minyak 25 miliar barel. Kalau betul-betul, 20% saja bisa diambil, 5 miliar itu sudah baik lah buat Indonesia,"" ""Apalagi juga gasnya potensinya sampai 47 TCF. Ini dua kali dari Masela dan sama dengan Natuna cuma Natuna banyak CO2-nya. jadi ini yang memang harus kita coba upayakan,"" kata Menteri ESDM, Arifin Tasrif dalam konferensi pers di Gedung Kementerian ESDM, beberapa waktu yang lalu. Meskipun, mempunyai potensi yang cukup besar untuk dikembangkan. Namun, wilayah kerja yang berlokasi di wilayah perbatasan dengan Papua Nugini tersebut berada di dalam area hutan nasional lorentz. ""Padahal tetangganya di Papua Nugini sudah menghasilkan minyak dan ada LNG fasilitas,"" ujarnya. Oleh sebab itu, pemerintah akan mencoba mengoptimalkan sumber daya alam yang ada di dalam negeri. Pasalnya, jika didiamkan saja, Indonesia akan kehilangan devisa untuk impor. ""Tentu saja harus kita antisipasi. Kita sedang mengupayakan berbicara dengan KLHK tapi ini juga terkait penetapan dari unesco, kita berharap akan ada solusi yang baik gimana kita bisa memanfaatkannya,"" ujarnya. Praktisi Migas, Hadi Ismoyo mengungkapkan bahwa di kedua daerah tersebut masih minim sumur minyak yang belum didukung oleh data seismik. Sehingga Hadi mengungkapkan bahwa pembuktian bahwa memang ada cadangan minyak seperti yang disebutkan oleh data Kementerian ESDM merupakan perjalanan yang panjang. ""Potensi yang ada di sana itu memang besar tapi jangan dibikin spekulasi seolah-olah miliaran barel tanpa data yang baik atau ata yang sudah diverifikasi. Karena disana belum ada sumur, mungkin satu sumur yang didukung dengan seismik yang sedikit. Jadi kita perlu banyak sekali tahapan-tahapan eksplorasi diseminasi. Untuk membuktikan reserve itu sebesar itu, masih jauh,"" jelasnya kepada CNBC Indonesia dalam program 'Energy Corner', Senin (13/2/2023). Hadi menilai, data potensi yang dirilis oleh Kementerian ESDM bisa menimbulkan spekulasi yang berlebihan di masyarakat. Dia beberkan fakta di lapangan yang dialami saat ini adalah untuk mendapatkan 1 barel minyak harus melewati segala macam rintangan. ""Kelihatanya angka-angka yang disampaikan itu terlalu bombastis, terlalu berbau propaganda. Masyarakat umum dicekoki dengan angka-angka yang super spekulatif, itu nggak bagus juga. Kita di lapangan itu kan mengerti ya untuk mendapatkan 1 barel minyak saja susahnya minta ampun,"" tandasnya. Sedangkan sebelumnya, Satuan Kerja Khusus Pelaksana Kegiatan Usaha Hulu Minyak dan Gas Bumi (SKK Migas) juga tak menampik bahwa potensi sumber daya migas di wilayah Warim, Papua dan Seram, Maluku cukup besar. Kepala SKK Migas Dwi Soetjipto mengatakan pihaknya telah melakukan pemetaan di kedua wilayah tersebut. Pengembangan dua wilayah ini diharapkan dapat berkontribusi dalam peningkatan produksi migas nasional. Menurut Dwi, potensi minyak area Warim dan Seram diproyeksikan bisa mencapai dua kali lipat dari cadangan minyak yang ada saat ini, yang hanya 2,3 miliar barel per hari. Oleh sebab itu, apabila kedua wilayah tersebut dapat dikembangkan, akan menambah cadangan minyak nasional untuk jangka panjang. ""Kalau seandainya kita bisa fokus 2 ini dan ini sukses bisa menambah cadangan minyak kita jangka panjang, tentu saja termasuk produksinya,"" katanya. Menurut Dwi, untuk pengembangan area Warim sendiri, Kementerian ESDM saat ini tengah menjalin komunikasi dengan Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (KLHK) untuk meneruskan izin pengembangan. Pasalnya area Warim lokasinya berada di area hutan nasional lorentz. ""Seram gak ada isu mengenai lingkungan, hanya Warim saja.

Harga Batu Bara Acuan RI Resmi Diubah,https://akcdn.detik.net.id/visual/2021/08/06/kapal-tongkang-batu-bara-cnbc-indonesiatri-susilo-9_169.jpeg?w=360&q=90,https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/news/20230309101002-4-420179/juragan-makin-happy-harga-batu-bara-acuan-ri-resmi-diubah,"Jakarta, CNBC Indonesia - Para juragan-juragan atau produsen batu bara Indonesia pasti gembira. Baru saja, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) resmi mengubah pedoman penetapan harga patokan untuk penjualan komoditas batu bara. Aturan baru itu tertuang dalam Keputusan Menteri ESDM Noor 41.K/MB.01/MEM.B/2023 Staf Khusus Menteri ESDM Bidang Percepatan Tata Kelola Mineral dan Batu Bara Irwandy Arif menyampaikan evaluasi formula HBA sendiri dilakukan karena mempertimbangkan permintaan dari para pelaku usaha. Pasalnya HBA yang diperoleh dari empat indeks yakni Indonesia Coal Index (ICI), Newcastle Export Index (NEX), Globalcoal Newcastle Index (GCNC), dan Platts yang digunakan pemerintah cukup memberatkan. Di mana masing-masing indeks bobotnya dipukul rata yakni 25%. ""Apa yang terjadi dengan lonjakan harga, menjadikan HBA tinggi dan harga jual rendah ini memberatkan industri karena royalti dibebankan HBA. Oktober 2022 itu puncaknya di atas US$ 300 per ton sekarang ini Januari Februari Maret hampir sama US$ 200 per ton,"" kata Irwandy dalam diskusi Peningkatan Kapasitas Media Sektor Minerba, Rabu (8/3/2023). Sementara itu, menurut Irwandy mengenai indeks yang baru akan memakai harga dua bulan sebelumnya dengan persentase yang berbeda beda. Misalnya, 70% harga bulan ini dan 30% di bulan ini atau sebaliknya. ""Kemudian persentasenya di ambil dari EPNB untuk dilihat berapa persentase yang terjadi kira kira begitu. Sehingga harga jual dengan HBA tidak terlalu jauh sehingga adil buat pemerintah dan adil buat perusahaan,"" kata dia. Seperti diketahui, mengacu aturan baru itu, terdapat tiga formula harga batu bara acuan: Pertama , Harga Batubara Acuan (dalam kesetaraan nilai kalori 6.322 kcal/kg GAR, Total Moisture 12,58%, total sulphur 0,71% dan Ash 7,58% maka HBAnya: HBA = (0,7*Pm) + (0.3*Pm-1) (US$/ton). Pm adalah rata-rata harga jual batubara dengan kalori 6.200 -6.400 kcal/kg GAR pada bulan sebelumnya (US$/ton). Pm-1 adalah rata-rata harga jual batu bara dengan kalori 6.200 -6.400 kcal/kg GAR pada dua bulan sebelumnya (US$/ton). Kedua , Harga Batu Bara Acuan (dalam kesetaraan nilai kalori 5.200 kcal/kg GAR, Total Moisture 23,12%, total sulphur 0,69% dan Ash 6% maka HBA-nya: HBA I= (0.7*Pm) + (0.3*Pm-1) (US$/ton). Pm adalah rata-rata harga jual batubara dengan kalori 5.100 -5.300 kcal/kg GAR pada bulan sebelumnya (US$/ton). Pm-1 adalah rata-rata harga jual batu bara dengan kalori 5.100 -5.300 kcal/kg GAR pada dua bulan sebelumnya (US$/ton). Ketiga , Harga Batu Bara Acuan II (dalam kesetaraan nilai kalori 4.200 kcal/kg GAR, Total Moisture 35,29%, total sulphur 0,2% dan Ash 4,21% maka HBA-nya: HBA II= (0.7*Pm) + (0.3*Pm-1) (US$/ton).

Aturan baru ini akan menggunakan harga dua bulan sebelumnya dengan persentase yang berbeda. Tiga formula tersebut adalah Harga Batubara Acuan, Harga Batu Bara Acuan I, dan Harga Batu Bara Acuan II masing-masing dengan rincian kalori, Total Moisture, total sulphur, dan Ash yang berbeda.

150,tempo,JKN Buka Peluang Terciptanya Kedaulatan Industri Farmasi,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/05/id_1186348/1186348_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698910/jkn-buka-peluang-terciptanya-kedaulatan-industri-farmasi,"INFO NASIONAL -- Direktur Perencanaan, Pengembangan dan Manajemen Risiko BPJS Kesehatan Mahlil Ruby menyampaikan, kemandirian industri farmasi kesehatan dapat dicapai dengan cara penguatan manufaktur farmasi dalam negeri, revitalisasi penyediaan bahan baku obat serta riset dan pengembangan inovasi farmasi dalam negeri. Ia juga menilai peluang di sektor industri Farmasi terbuka lebar akibat implikasi Program Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) yang saat ini mencatat jumlah kepesertaan mencapai 248,7 juta jiwa dengan total pemanfaatan layanan kesehatan 502,8 juta kali di tahun 2022.Jika industri farmasi mampu berdaulat, cukup dengan internal market, kita bisa memaksimalkan konsumsi dalam negeri dengan banyaknya jumlah penduduk Indonesia yang telah menjadi peserta JKN. Artinya disini masih terus terbuka peluangnya dalam pasar industri. Kami berharap, pelaku industri farmasi senantiasa berkomitmen meningkatkan kompetensi dan menghasilkan produk farmasi yang bermutu sehingga upaya untuk menjamin kesehatan masyarakat indonesia dapat berjalan dengan optimal, terang Mahlil ketika memberi sambutan dalam Rapat Kerja Nasional dan Seminar Nasional Inter Profesi Farmasi dan Kesehatan di Indonesia, Federasi Serikat Pekerja Farmasi dan Kesehatan (FSP Farkes)  KSPSI di Surabaya, Sabtu (04/03).Mahlil menambahkan BPJS Kesehatan senantiasa berkomitmen agar Program Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional dapat berjalan dengan optimal dan terjaga keberlangsungannya. BPJS Kesehatan juga senantiasa berupaya meningkatkan mutu layanan kepada peserta dengan bersinergi dan berkolaborasi dengan berbagai pemangku kepentingan.Kami menyadari bahwa penyelenggaraan Program JKN dan upaya mewujudkan masyarakat Indonesia yang sehat dan sejahtera akan lebih optimal melalui sinergi dengan berbagai pihak dan pemangku kepentingan, termasuk dengan pelaku industri farmasi, terang Mahlil dalam kegiatan yang juga dihadiri oleh Wakil Menteri Ketenagakerjaan RI Afriansyah Noor di depan Anggota Wantimpres RI Soekarwo, Dewan Pengarah Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) Marsudi Wahyu Kisworo, Sekjen DPD KSPSI Bibit Gunawan, Ketua Umum FSP Farkes  KSPSI Agung Nugroho dan Kepala Dinas Ketenagakerjaan Provinsi Jawa Timur Himawan Estu Bagijo ini.Dalam kegiatan yang sama, Afriansyah menjelaskan salah satu fokus pembangunan Pemerintah Indonesia saat ini adalah Pembangunan Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM). Pengembangan kompetensi SDM adalah suatu hal yang tidak dapat ditawar lagi karena kompetensi dan daya saing merupakan langkah kuat yang harus dimiliki oleh tenaga kerja, termasuk didalamnya pada sektor farmasi kesehatan.Ia menambahkan bahwa Pandemi Covid-19 dapat terkendali dengan baik sehingga PPKM dapat dicabut pada bulan Desember 2022. Hal tersebut tidak lepas dari dukungan semua pihak, termasuk sektor farmasi dan kesehatan yang berkompeten sehingga dapat menjadi hulu tombak dalam memberikan pelayanan kesehatan.Dengan adanya sinergi melalui rapat kerja nasional ini diharapkan menjadi forum dialog yang memiliki jangkauan strategis, yang tidak hanya membahas komitmen namun juga membahas langkah bersama melakukan koordinasi dan evaluasi program serta pencapaian organisasi. Saya harap melalui kegiatan ini dapat menghasilkan rumusan-rumusan program yang lebih konstruktif yang disesuaikan dengan perkembangan ekonomi global dan diselaraskan dengan iklim investasi, terang Afriansyah.Sementara menurut Ketua Umum FSP Farkes  KSPSI Agung Nugroho, cita-cita mewujudkan sektor farmasi dan kesehatan adalah hal yang sangat penting dan mendesak untuk kepentingan bangsa Indonesia.

Kebakaran terjadi Jumat malam, 3 Maret 2023, yang menewaskan 17 orang dan 600 lebih mengungsi.""Tidak bisa lagi ditinggali, tetapi harus ada solusinya. Bisa saja Plumpang-nya digeser ke reklamasi atau penduduknya yang digeser ke relokasi,"" kata Jokowi saat ditemui mengunjungi para pengungsi kebakaran Depo Pertamina di RPTRA Rasela, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Minggu, 5 Maret 2023.Namun Jokowi tidak merinci lebih lanjut reklamasi yang dia maksud. Menurut dia, solusi akan dibicarakan oleh PT Pertamina dan Heru. ""Tapi semuanya memang harus zona-zona berbahaya ini tidak hanya di sini saja harus diaudit, harus dievaluasi semuanya karena menyangkut nyawa. Tadi saya sudah perintahkan semuanya,"" ujarnya.Usul Ma'ruf AminSementara, Wakil Presiden Ma'ruf Amin mengusulkan agar depo Pertamina di Plumpang dipindah menjauhi permukiman penduduk pascaterbakar pada Jumat malam kemarin. Kebakaran depo menjalar ke pemukiman warga hingga mengakibatkan jatuhnya korban jiwa.""Saya berharap supaya depo ini lebih aman itu bisa direlokasi di pelabuhan, di daerah Pelindo. Saya kira begitu,"" ujar Ma'ruf Amin di kawasan Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Ma'ruf berujar kawasan permukiman warga yang berdempetan dengan depo Pertamina juga bakal ditata ulang agar lebih baik dan aman. Selain di kawasan Plumpang, Ma'ruf mengatakan bakal meminta agar obyek vital pemerintah lain yang lokasinya berdempetan dengan pemukiman warga untuk dievaluasi.Evaluasi obyek vitalSementara itu, Menteri BUMN Erick Thohir yang turut mengunjungi lokasi kebakaran, mengatakan sudah sejak lama menekankan untuk mengevaluasi objek vital pemerintah yang berada di lingkungan masyarakat. Selain kilang minyak, Erick menyebut fasilitas seperti pupuk di Sumatra Selatan juga ditinjau.""Buffer antara titik kemanan dan tentu titik dari masyarakat itu masih terlalu dekat. Nah, inilah yang mau kita zoning ulang, tata ulang, tidak hanya di Pertamina, termasuk PLN, termasuk pupuk,"" kata Erick.Dengan adanya zoning wilayah aman antara pemukiman warga dan objek vital, diharapkan masyarakat bisa lebih aman. ""Semoga ini bisa menjadi solusi juga, bahwa masyarakat mengerti bahwa kawasan itu tidak aman, jangan ditinggalkan kembali,"" kata Erick.Selanjutnya: Usulan soal Buffer ZoneJokowi mengakui usulan pembuatan buffer zone sudah pernah dibahas Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta di masa-masa sebelumnya. Termasuk di era kepemimpinannya di DKI Jakarta pada 2012-2014.""Dulu memang sudah direncanakan untuk dibuat air di kanan kirinya sungai, tetapi memang belum sampai kepada titik mencarikan solusi kepada penduduknya yang ada di situ,"" kata Jokowi saat ditemui mengunjungi para pengungsi kebakaran Depo Pertamina di RPTRA Rasela, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Minggu, 5 Maret 2023.""Tanah merah-nya ini kan padat dan penuh. Semuanya harus dicarikan solusi. Saya kira keamanan masyarakat, keselamatan masyarakat harus menjadi titik yang utama,"" kata dia. Tanah Merah mengacu pada Jalan Tanah Merah Bawah yang jadi lokasi kebakaran.Jokowi menyebut seharusnya zona ini harusnya menjadi zona air, seperti misalnya dibuat sungai yang memisahkan Depo dan pemukiman. Tujuannya untuk melindungi objek vital yang ada di dalam Depo. ""Karena barang-barang didalamnya barang-barang yang sangat bahaya untuk berdekatan dengan masyarakat, apalagi dengan pemukiman penduduk,"" kata dia.Usulan soal buffer zone ini diungkit Heru saat mengunjungi lokasi kebakaran pada Jumat malam, beberapa jam setelah Depo Pertamina terbakar. Heru menyebut tahun 2009, pemerintah daerah sudah mengusulkan buffer zone selebar 50 meter. ""Kira-kira begitu, kami kembalikan ke Pertamina,"" kata Heru usai menggelar rapat darurat di Pos Koramil Koja, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu dini hari, 4 Maret 2023.Sekretaris Daerah DKI Jakarta Joko Agus Setyono mengatakan Pemerintah Provinsi akan berkerja sama dengan PT Pertamina untuk melanjutkan rencana pembuatan buffer zone di kawasan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara. ""Kita bikin kerja sama, lah, sama Pertamina,"" kata Joko kepada wartawan di Koramil Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Namun, eks Kepala BPK Bali itu belum merinci soal pembuatan buffer zone ini. ""Ya, pastinya, semuanya itu, upaya-upaya untuk mengarah yang lebih bagus,"" ujarnya.Usai kebakaran, masalah status lahan dan bangunan warga pun jadi sorotan. Anggota Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPRD DKI Jakarta Gilbert Simanjuntak menyatakan sepatutnya mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan ikut bertanggungjawab atas kebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat malam lalu.Menurut Gilbert, sejak awal sudah diketahui bahwa lahan di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang tidak boleh ada permukiman dalam jarak tertentu. Lahan yang terkena kebakaran tadi adalah milik PT Pertamina.""Lahan milik PT Pertamina ditempati warga akan tetapi oleh Anies sewaktu menjabat Gubernur diberi IMB, yang jelas bertentangan dengan peraturan,"" ujar Gilbert dalam keterangannya pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Gilbert menilai IMB yang dikeluarkan Anies Baswedan saat menjabat Gubernur DKI membuat persoalan semakin rumit. Menurut dia, saat itu Anies terkesan lebih mementingkan pemenuhan janji kampanye walau harus menabrak aturan. ""Kesalahan itu tidak sepatutnya berulang.""Berkaca dari kejadian tersebut, Gilbert penduduk di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang dipindahkan agar tidak menjadi korban lagi.Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan menerbitkan IMB (Izin Mendirikan Bangunan) Sementara kepada penduduk Kampung Tanah Merah pada Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.""Ini adalah jalan tengah yang kami ambil untuk menyelesaikan masalah bangunan-bangunan yang berada di tanah yang status legalnya belum tuntas. Tapi mereka faktanya ada di tempat ini sudah puluhan tahun,"" kata Anies Baswedan di Kampung Tanah Merah, Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.Pertamina enggan berkomentar lebih lanjut ketika ditanya mengenai

Menurut Titi, langkah tersebut penting dilakukan untuk menyaring nama bakal caleg PKB yang akan berlaga di Pemilu 2024.Dalam seleksi penyaringan nama caleg tersebut, Titi menjadi salah satu penguji dari pihak eksternal.""Ini proses yang sangat bagus, sangat baik, bagaimana PKB memfasilitasi orang-orang terbaik dari luar partai, tetapi tetap harus ikut proses meritokrasi di partai, harus diuji bagaimana pemahaman mereka terhadap ideologi partai, bagaimana visi misi partai, program yang dibawa oleh partai, hingga struktur partai,"" ujar Titi dalam keterangannya, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Meritokrasi merupakan sistem yang memberikan kesempatan kepada seseorang untuk memimpin berdasarkan kemampuan atau prestasi, bukan kekayaan atau kelas sosial. Sistem meritokrasi mendasarkan penilaian pada kinerja serta pencapaian yang ditunjukkan.Berdasarkan hasil seleksi yang dilakukannya, Titi menyebut Bacaleg PKB punya semangat yang bagus. Mereka, kata Titi, tidak hanya berupaya untuk hadir di tengah daerah pemilihan yang PKB sudah punya kursi atau sudah ada petahana, namun juga keinginan menambah kursi.""Dan ternyata narasi yang selalu dibawa adalah menambah kursi. Jadi ketika mereka maju sebagai Bacaleg adalah dalam semangat kursinya harus bertambah,"" kata Titi.Penyaringan nama-nama bacaleg itu sebelumnya telah digelar sejak 22 Februari 2023 dengan total pendaftar sementara untuk DPR RI sebanyak 531 orang, bacaleg DPRD Provinsi 2.177 orang, dan bacaleg DPRD Kabupaten/Kota sebanyak 15.419 orang.Wakil Ketua Umum Bidang Pemenangan Pemilu yang juga Ketua Lembaga Pemenangan Pemilu DPP PKB, Jazilul Fawaid mengatakan pihaknya sengaja melibatkan penguji eksternal. Tujuannya agar caleg yang terjaring benar-benar caleg yang memiliki kapasistas mumpuni dan memiliki integritas tinggi sebagai calon wakil rakyat.Kami ingin hasil dari UKK (uji kepatutan dan kelayakan) ini benar-benar menghasilkan balaceg yang terbaik dan punya integritas tinggi untuk kepentingan bangsa, ujar Jazilul.Wakil Ketua MPR RI ini mengatakan bahwa UKK ini tidak hanya dilakukan untuk bacaleg DPR RI, namun juga bacaleg DPR kabupaten/kota dan provinsi. Pelibatan pihak eksternal ini juga sebagai bentuk keterbukaan yang dilakukan DPP PKB dalam proses penjaringan bacaleg.Dengan tingginya antusiasme bacaleg PKB, Jazilul optimistis bisa meraih target

Dalam kondisi darurat seperti ini Mulyanto meminta Pertamina fokus mengatasi kebakaran dan menangani korban dengan baik.Meski dalam kondisi darurat, ia berharap Pertamina tetap dapat menyediakan pasokan BBM bagi masyarakat. Mulyanto yakin Pertamina memiliki rencana kerja cadangan (contigency plan) yang memungkinkan pelayanan pengadaan BBM tetap berjalan, meskipun terjadi musibah kebakaran di depo Plumpang.""Pertamina perlu mengambil langkah untuk menutupi kekurangan pasokan distribusi BBM dan gas di wilayah Jabodetabek agar kegiatan ekonomi masyarakat lainnya tidak terganggu,"" kata Mulyanto.Ia pun meminta semua pihak untuk memberikan kesempatan kepada Pertamina menyelesaikan masalah kebakaran ini. Menurutnya, hal ini lebih penting karena menyangkut keamanan dan keselamatan orang-orang yang ada di kawasan depo dan lingkungan masyarakat sekitar.""Kita jangan berpolemik dulu tentang penyebab kebakaran. Masalah itu bisa kita bicarakan setelah kebakaran diselesaikan dan penanganan korban sudah dituntaskan,"" ujar Mulyanto.Untuk mencegah kejadian serupa Mulyanto minta Pertamina segera melakukan audit keamanan di semua depo dan kilang BBM. Sebab, menurut Mulyanto, kebakaran di depo dan kilang BBM Pertamina termasuk sering terjadi.Karena itu proses pemeriksaan dan pengawasan perlu ditingkatkan. Apalagi kondisi cuaca saat ini sering hujan disertai kilat dan petir, sehingga bisa menyebabkan kebakaran di kilang-kilang minyak.""Pertamina harus sungguh-sungguh melakukan penelitian untuk mengetahui kondisi setiap depo dan kilang yang dimiliki sehingga dapat dilakukan mitigasi dan pencegahan di masa-masa mendatang,"" kata Mulyanto.Ia juga meminta pemeriksaan depo dan kilang BBM dilakukan secara berkala. Bagi fasilitas depo dan kilang BBM yang sudah tua harus diaudit secara komprehensif.""Langkah mitigasi dan pencegahan yang diambil dari kasus sebelumnya menjadi penting.

Dia mengatakan manuver itu harus diselidiki dari mana sumber kekuatannya.""Untuk itu, menghadapi manuver-manuver dengan kekuatan yang harus kita selidiki dari mana kekuatan itu, yang mencoba untuk menggunakan hukum sebagai alat yang akan merombak seluruh tatanan tatanan demokratis yang diamanatkan oleh konstitusi,"" kata Hasto saat memberi sambutan di acara PDIP di Taman Halaman Banteng, Jakarta, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Hasto menegaskan amanat konstitusi mengamanatkan bahwa pemilu hasil harus dijalankan setiap 5 tahun.Hasto mengatakan ini berkaitan dengan putusan PN Jakarta Pusat yang memerintahkan KPU menunda Pemilu 2024. Putusan ini berkaitan dengan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU. Diamenyebutkan, keputusan tersebut merupakan keputusan yang melawan amanat konstitusi.""Ada sesuatu kekuatan besar di balik peristiwa pengadilan PM Jakarta Pusat tersebut yang mencoba untuk menundaPemilu 2024,"" ujar Hasto.

Bahkan, ia menilai putusan tersebut merupakan bentuk pelanggaran terhadap konstitusi.Bivitri mengatakan merujuk pada Undang-undang Dasar 1945, pemilihan umum wajib dilaksanakan setiap lima tahun sekali. Karena itu, UU Pemilu tidak diberi ruang sama sekali untuk menunda pemilu secara nasional.""Memang ada di Pasal 400-an yang menyebut pemilu di daerah, sekali lagi di daerah bukan nasional, istilahnya pemilu susulan,"" kata Bivitri melalui keterangan video pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Selain itu, Bivitri juga mengatakan pasal tersebut juga membatasi alasan penundaan pemilu di daerah dengan kejadian luar biasa. Misalnya, kata dia, adalah adanya bencana alam atau keadaan darurat lain yang mengharuskan pelaksanaan pemilu di daerah harus ditunda.""Misalnya ada gempa bumi seperti di Cianjur kemarin gitu, menunda pemilu selama beberapa bulan itu boleh. Tapi tidak secara nasional,"" kata dia.Bivitri juga mengatakan putusan Pengadilan Negeri tidak bisa menetapkan penundaan pemilu. Sebab, menurut dia, hal tersebut bukan ranah pengadilan negeri untuk menetapkan penundaan pemilu. ""Tidak melalui putusan pengadilan, tapi melalui peraturan KPU,"" kata pengajar Sekolah Tinggi Hukum Jentera tersebut.Selain itu, Bivitri mengatakan gugatan Partai Prima atas KPU bukanlah kewenangan Pengadilan Negeri untuk mengadili. Sebab, ia menyebut gugatan Prima tersebut merupakan ranah administrasi negara, bukan perdata.""Tapi yang aneh kalau ada unsur melawan hukum dari penguasa seharusnya dibawa ke Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara, tapi diterima di Pengadilan Negeri,"" ujar dia.Terakhir, Bivitri menyebut dalam ranah perdata terikat dengan konsep privat. Sehingga, ia mengatakan dampak putusan dari peradilan perdata juga hanya boleh dirasakan oleh pihak penggugat dan tergugat. ""Bukan untuk umum. Jadi inilah alasan mengapa putusan ini keliru,"" kata Bivitri.Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat sebelumnya mengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU karena merasa dirugikan karena tidak lolos hasil administrasi Pemilu. ""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Sementara itu, KPU akan menempuh upaya hukum banding terhadap putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut. Komisioner KPU Idham Holik menyatakan dengan tegas pihaknya menolak putusan PN Jakpus.KPU RI akan banding atas putusan PN tersebut.

121,tempo,Pesan Yandri Susanto saat Pelantikan PC/PAC Fatayat NU,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/05/id_1186246/1186246_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698801/pesan-yandri-susanto-saat-pelantikan-pcpac-fatayat-nu,"INFO NASIONAL  Wakil Ketua MPR H. Yandri Susanto S.Pt. membuka acara Pelantikan Pimpinan Cabang (PC) dan Pimpinan Anak Cabang (PAC) Fatayat NU Serang Periode 2022  2027 dan Rapat Kerja Fatayat NU di Aula Pondok Pesantren Al Quran Bai Mahdi Sholeh Mamaun, Sindangheula, Pabuaran, Serang, Banten, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Selamat kepada pimpinan baru semoga kepengurusan ini mampu membawa amanah organisasi, ujarnya di hadapan ratusan perempuan NU dan sejumlah tokoh NU yang hadir.Tokoh NU yang hadir antara lain Ketua PCNU Serang H. Muhammad Robi UZT, Rais Syuriah PCNU Serang KH. Tubagus A, Khudori Yusuf, Pembina Fatayat PCNU Serang Ratu Rachmatuzakiyah, dan Ketua Fatayat PCNU Serang Farroh Syaita.Acara bertajuk Menciptakan Generasi Perempuan yang Mampu Menjaga Peradaban itu turut diramaikan oleh perwakilan dari Badan Otonomi (Banom) NU seperti Pagar Nusa, Lapeksdam, GP Ansor, serta para kiai dari berbagai pesantaren.Yandri mengingatkan para pengurus yang baru dilantik untuk menyegerakan kegiatan yang bermanfaat bagi umat. Jangan habis dilantik lalu tidak ada kegiatan, ujarnya. Buat program yang membumi bukan melangit.Kaderisasi didorong agar terus ditingkatkan agar militansi dan wibawa organisasi terlihat. Hal tersebut akan menjadi bekal untuk berkompetisi di tengah persaingan yang semakin berat. Jangan mengaku Fatayat kalau belum mengikuti latihan dasar, ujarnya.Yandri juga mengingatkan tantangan ke depan yang semakin berat. Fatayat harus merapatkan barisan untuk menjawab tantangan yang semakin kompleks. Berbagai problem di masyarakat menurutnya merupakan ladang dakwah bagi Fatayat.Saat ini banyak orang berdakwah merasa paling benar sendiri dan yang lain salah. Sikap tersebut, Yandir melanjutkan, harus dihindari. Lakukan dakwah secara pas, tuturnya. Berdakwah yang rahmatan lilalamin, ujarnya. Dakwah yang merangkul bukan memukul.Selain itu, Fatayat harus ikut mensosialisasikan Pancasila, UUD NRI Tahun 1945, NKRI, dan Bhinneka Tunggal Ika. Nah bagaimana Fatayat ikut mensosialisasikan Pancasila kepada perempuan-perempuan muda di luar Fatayat, kata dia.NU organisasi besar, dari pusat hingga pelosok-pelosok desa ada, katanya. Untuk itu organisasi yang didirikan oleh KH. Hasyim Asyari dan ulama lainnya itu diharap agar terus memperkuat tali silaturahmi dan persatuan serta kesatuan bangsa.Untuk diketahui, Pondok Pesantren Al Quran Bai Mahdi Sholeh Mamaun berada di bawah asuhan Yandri Susanto. Karena itu, Yandri menyatakan bahwa pesantren ini terbuka bagi setiap orang. Tempat ini terbuka bagi siapa saja yang mau menggunakannya. NU, Mathlaul Anwar, Muhammadiyah, Jamiatul Khoir, dan organisasi apa saja silahkan menggnakan tempat ini bila ada kegiatan.Tidak hanya organisasi massa, partai politik pun juga diperkenankan memanfaatkan aula yang ada untuk kegiatan.

78,tempo,PDIP Sebut Ada Kekuatan Besar di Balik Putusan PN Jakpus soal Tunda Pemilu 2024,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/04/id_1186031/1186031_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698500/pdip-sebut-ada-kekuatan-besar-di-balik-putusan-pn-jakpus-soal-tunda-pemilu-2024,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Sekretaris Jenderal PDIP Hasto Kristiyanto mengatakan ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024. Hasto menyebutkan, keputusan tersebut merupakan keputusan yang melawan amanat konstitusi.""Ada sesuatu kekuatan besar di balik peristiwa pengadilan PM Jakarta Pusat tersebut yang mencoba untuk menunda Pemilu 2024,"" kata Hasto saat memberi sambutan di acara PDIP di Taman Halaman Banteng, Jakarta, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Hasto mengatakan kekuatan besar itu mencoba memanfaatkan celah hukum sebagai upaya melakukan penundaan pemilu. ""Melakukan suatu gerak yang pada dasarnya inkonstitusional untuk menunda pemilu,"" ujar Hasto.Padahal, kata Hasto, Undang-Undangan Nomor 7 tahun 2017 tentang Pemilu telah jelas mengatur sengketa yang berkaitan dengan partai politik dan peserta pemilu hanya dilakukan oleh Bawaslu dan Pengadilan Tinggi Usaha Negara (PTUN). ""Karena Komisioner KPU adalah pejabat tata usaha negara,"" ucap Hasto.Sebelumnya, Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan KPU untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Keputusan tersebut disampaikan pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan.Keputusan tersebut diputuskan PN Jakpus karena majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum.

Apalagi di Indonesia yang memiliki beragam adat dan budaya sehingga ada banyak pula tradisi dalam menyambut bulan suci akhir bulan ini.Mengutip laman Dinas Kebudayaan Kota Yogyakarta, Nyadran adalah sebuah tradisi dalam kehidupan masyarakat Jawa yang pada awal merupakan budaya untuk mendoakan leluhur yang sudah meninggal. Seiring berjalannya waktu, Nyadran mengalami proses perkembangan hingga menjadi adat dan tradisi hingga saat ini. Nyadran menjadi salah satu tradisi masyarakat Jawa menjelang datangnya bulan Ramadan.Nyadran juga dikenal dengan sebutan Ruwahan, karena dilakukan pada bulan Ruwah yaitu sebuah bulan dalam penanggalan Jawa yang sama dengan Bulan Sya'ban dalam penanggalan Hijriyah. Sehingga dalam sejarahnya, tradisi Nyadran ini merupakan sebuah akulturasi budaya Jawa dan Islam.Kata Nyadran sendiri berasal dari bahasa Sanskerta yaituSraddha yang memiliki arti keyakinan. Menurut Yanu Endar Prasetyo, Nyadran atau Sadranan ini adalah tradisi yang untuk mengucapkan rasa syukur yang dilakukan secara kolektif dengan mengunjungi makam atau kuburan leluhur yang ada di suatu kelurahan atau desa.Nyadran dimaksudkan sebagai sarana mendoakan leluhur yang telah meninggal dunia, mengingatkan diri bahwa semua manusia pada akhirnya akan mengalami kematian, dan juga dijadikan sebagai sarana guna melestarikan budaya gotong royong dalam masyarakat sekaligus upaya untuk dapat menjaga keharmonisan bertetangga melalui kegiatan kembul bujono atau makan bersama.Tradisi Nyadran terdiri dari berbagai kegiatan, diantaranya:Pertama, melakukan Besik, yaitu membersihkan makam leluhur dari kotoran dan rerumputan. Pada kegiatan ini masyarakat dan antar keluarga saling bekerja sama gotong-royong untuk membersihkan makam leluhur.Kedua, Kirab. Yaitu kegiatan arak-arakan peserta Nyadran menuju ke tempat upacara adat dilangsungkan.Ketiga, Ujub yaitu menyampaikan maksud dari serangkaian upacara adat Nyadran oleh Pemangku Adat.Keempat, Doa. Biasanya Pemangku Adat akan memimpin kegiatan doa bersama yang ditujukan kepada roh leluhur yang sudah meninggal.Kelima, Kembul Bujono dan Tasyukuran atau makan bersama dan setiap keluarga yang mengikuti sesi ini harus membawa makanan sendiri. Makanan yang dibawa berupa makanan tradisional, seperti ayam ingkung, sambal goreng ati, urap sayur dengan lauk rempah, perkedel, tempe dan tahu bacem, dan lain sebagainya.Setelah masyarakat telah berkumpul dan membawa makanannya masing-masing, maka makanan akan diletakkan didepan untuk didoakan oleh pemuka agama setempat untuk mendapatkan berkah dan kemudian tukar menukar makanan yang tadi dibawa oleh masyarakat.Kembul Bujono menjadi rangkaian untuk mengakhiri acara sekaligus dengan saling bersenda gurau agar juga bisa saling mengakrabkan diri.Seiring berjalannya waktu, terdapat

Vonis tersebut menjadi kontroversi karena Oyong diduga melanggar yuridiksi menangani perkara perdata.Dari catatan Tempo, putusan penundaan Pemilu 2024 bukan menjadi satu-satunya vonis kontroversial Oyong. Berikut ini beberapa vonis Oyong yang dinilai kontroversial.1. Vonis Ringan Terdakwa Kasus Penculikan dan PembunuhanPada pertengahan 2021, Oyong memvonis ringan Edy Suwanto Sukandi alias Ko Ahwat Tango, terdakwa penculik dan pembunuh pengusaha rental mobil Jefri Wijaya alias Asiong. Oyong yang saat itu menjadi Ketua Majelis Hakim, menjatuhkan vonis hukuman lima bulan dan tiga hari penjara kepada Ko Ahwat Tango.Vonis tersebut sangat jauh tuntutan jaksa penuntut umum (JPU) yang menjerat terdakwa dengan Pasal 340 tentang pembunuhan berencana, karena turut menyusun pertemuan dengan para pembunuh Asiong. Namun, Oyong memvonis terdakwa dengan Pasal 333 ayat (3) KUHP jo Pasal 56 KUHP tentang Perampasan Kemerdekaan yang memiliki ancaman hukuman 12 tahun penjara.Atas tindakannya ini, Oyong dilaporkan Komisi Yudisial ke Pengawasan Hakim (Waskim). Namun, sampai sekarang belum diketahui tindak lanjut dari laporan tersebut.2. Aniaya Wartawan TelevisiBeberapa tahun sebelum kasus vonis ringan, Oyong juga pernah tersandung kasus penganiayaan terhadap jurnalis televisi lokal Juhri Samanery pada 2010 saat bertugas di PN Ambon. Kejadian itu berlangsung setelah proses sidang praperadilan Wakil Bupati Maluku Tenggara Barat, Lukas Uwuratuw.Penganiayaan terjadi saat wartawan hendak melakukan wawancara terhadap Oyong atas kasus tersebut. Namun, Hakim tersebut justru menganiaya Juhri hingga berujung pelaporan.Akibatnya, Oyong diperiksa inspektur wilayah Badan Pengawas Mahkamah Agung. Kasus tersebut sempat ditangani Polres Ambon. Dia lantas dimutasi ke PN Medan, pada 9 Februari 2017. Di sana Oyong merangkap sebagai Humas PN Medan sebelum dimutasi ke PN Jakarta Pusat.3. Bebaskan Wanita yang Tipu Anggota DPR dengan Mengaku Keturunan Nyi Roro KidulPada November 2021 di Pengadilan Negeri Medan, Oyong menjadi Ketua Majelis Hakim untuk kasus penipuan berkedok keturunan Nyi Roro Kidul dengan korbannya anggota DPR RI Rudi Hartono Bangun. Terdakwa Siska Sari Maulidhina atau Siska, dituding melakukan penipuan terhadap Rudi yang merupakan mantan kekasihnya dengan mengaku sebagai Nyi Roro Kidul hingga mengakibatkan kerugian hingga Rp4 miliar.JPU menilai Siska terbukti melanggar Pasal 378 Jo Pasal 55 ayat (1) ke 1 KUHP serta pencucian uang sebagaimana diatur dan diancam pidana dalam Pasal 3 UU RI No. 8 Tahun 2010.

""Nikah pada dasarnya adalah ajaran Agama Islam. Dan syariah islam sangat menganjurkan membantu mempermudah pernikahan,"" kata HNW, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Menurutnya, permintaan BKKBN agar KUA tidak menikahkan kecuali calon pasangan pengantin sudah memiliki sertifikat Elektronik Siap Menikah dan Siap Hamil (Elsimil) berpotensi menyulitkan prosesi pernikahan dan membuat mahal biaya nikah. Ditambah lagi peraturan Menteri Agama Nomor 20 Tahun 2019 tentang pencatatan pernikahan tidak mensyaratkan sertifikat Elsimil untuk mendaftarkan kehendak nikah, apalagi larangan bagi KUA untuk menikahkan bila calon pengantin tidak membawa Elsimil tersebut.""Selain tak ada ketentuan tersebut di PMA 20/2019, prosedur pemeriksaan kesehatan bisa menimbulkan kesulitan dan menambah pembiayaan yang memberatkan calon pengantin, padahal di saat yang sama muncul tren nikah di KUA yang diapresiasi Kemenag, karena bisa meringankan biaya, ujarnya.HNW pun mengingatkan kasus seks bebas di kalangan remaja dan anak muda semakin meningkat setiap tahunnya. Data Komnas Perempuan menyebutkan, di tahun 2021 sebanyak 59.709 anak terpaksa menikah karena mayoritasnya sudah hamil di luar nikah, dimana angka tersebut naik 7 kali lipat dari tahun 2016.Karena itu pernikahan yang murah sebagai solusi mendasar masalah pergaulan bebas seharusnya dipermudah, bukan dipersulit dengan adanya syarat tambahan yang tidak solutif,"" kata HNW.Menurutnya, tes kesehatan pra-nikah sebaiknya dijadikan sebagai himbauan yang masif disosialisasikan.

""Orang mau ibadah saja masa harus minta rekomendasi? Kita permudah, langsung kita kasih. Jadi paspor itu adalah hak warga negara, itu prinsipnya, sehingga kita harus berikan dengan mudah,"" ujarnya.Dia menjelaskan syarat surat rekomendasi dalam permohonan paspor mungkin dianggap bukan urusan sulit bagi sebagian masyarakat, namun bagi masyarakat yang tinggal jauh dari kota besar, syarat surat rekomendasi dari kantor agama bisa menjadi syarat yang cukup merepotkan.""Jangan lihat Jakarta. Misalnya dia ada di Sumatera, dia harus empat jam dari rumah atau kampungnya ke kantor imigrasi daerah, kemudian pemohon paspor itu harus ada rekomendasi, beliau balik lagi empat jam. Habis waktu untuk bolak balik,"" kata Silmy.Terbuka untuk perbaikan layananSilmy mengatakan dirinya sangat terbuka terhadap masukan dari masyarakat mengenai apa saja yang harus diperbaiki dari layanan imigrasi.Dia menambahkan pemohon paspor umroh adalah mereka yang ingin menjalankan ibadah, maka Ditjen Imigrasi harus memberikan pelayan terbaik kepada pemohon paspor umroh sesuai dengan tugasnya

Rencananya Komisi Yudisial akan memanggil ketiga Hakim PN Jakarta Pusat yaitu T. Oyong, H. Bakri, dan Dominggus Silaban.""Untuk itu, KY akan melakukan pendalaman terhadap putusan itu, terutama untuk melihat apakah ada dugaan pelanggaran perilaku yang terjadi. Salah satu bagian dari pendalaman itu bisa jadi dengan memanggil hakim untuk dimintakan klarifikasi."" ujarnya dalam keterangan tertulis pada 3 Maret 2023.KY juga telah berkomunikasi bersama Mahkamah Agung dalam mencermati substansi putusan yang dibuat oleh para Hakim tersebut""Kami juga akan berkomunikasi dengan Mahkamah Agung terkait dengan putusan ini serta aspek perilaku hakim yang terkait.""ucapnya.Menurutnya, Putusan Pengadilan sudah seharusnya bersandar aspek demokratis, aspek aspirasi masyarakat secara sosiologis dan patuh pada Undang-Undang Dasar 1945.""Putusan pengadilan tidak bekerja di ruang hampa karena ada aspirasi yang hidup di masyarakat secara sosiologis, ada aspek yuridis di mana kepatuhan terhadap UUD 1945 dan undang-undang sangatlah penting, serta pertimbangan-pertimbangan lain, seperti nilai-nilai demokrasi."" ujarnya.Sebelumnya, Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Perintah tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukanPartai Primadengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Putusan tersebut dibacakan oleh Majelis Hakim pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023. Adapun Ketua Majelis Hakim yang menyidangkan gugatan tersebut adalah T. Oyong, dengan hakim anggota H. Bakri dan Dominggus Silaban.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum. Adapun perbuatan melawan hukum yang dimaksud adalah KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik calon peserta pemilu.Selain penundaan, pengadilan juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta. Pengadilan juga menyatakan bahwa penggugat, yakni Partai Prima adalah partai politik yang dirugikan dalam verifikasi administrasi.Selanjutnya: Dinilai lampaui yurisdiksiAdapunpakar Hukum Tata Negara Feri Amsari menyebut putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tentangpenundaan Pemilu2024 dinilai aneh karena melampaui yurisdiksi. Menurut Feri, dalam Peraturan Mahkamah Agung Nomor 2 Tahun 2019 Pasal 10 dam Pasal 11 telah diatur yurisdiksi pengadilan negeri dalam penanganan perkara perbuatan melanggar hukum (PMH).Menurut aturan tersebut, jika ada pihak yang mengajukan perkara PMH ke Pengadilan Negeri, maka pengadilan negeri bakal melimpahkannya ke Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara (PTUN) karena bukan yurisdiksinya.""Jika pun Pengadilan Negeri sudah menjalankan perkara tersebut karena luput, khilaf, misalnya, maka harus diputus tidak dapat diterima,"" kata Feri dalam diskusi virtual, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Menurut Feri, aturan ini sudah ada dari tahun 2019 dan telah menjadi tradisi di pengadilan negeri untuk melimpahkan perkara PMH ke PTUN. Jika ada pemohon yang nekat mengajukan PMH ke Pengadilan Negeri, maka menurut Feri, Pengadilan Negeri bakal menolaknya.""Makanya aneh, tiba-tiba khusus untuk PMH ini diajukan di PN Jakarta Pusat, kemudian dijalankan bahkan diputuskan perkaranya. Jadi, ini sudah dilanggar,"" kata Feri.Dianggap langgar konstitusiSelain itu, Feri menyebut Majelis HakimPengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusatjuga telah melanggar UUD Negara RI Tahun 1945 yang telah menyatakan pemilu dilaksanakan setiap lima tahun sekali. Dengan adanya UUD ini, maka vonis Pengadilan cacat karena melanggar konstitusi.Selain itu, Feri menyebut gugatan yang diajukan Partai Prima ke Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat mengenai gagalnya partai tersebut dalam proses verifikasi oleh KPU. Namun, ia heran keputusan Hakim justru menunda pemilu.""Kalau memang masalahnya soal verifikasi administrasi, kalau itu masalah keperdataannya perbaiki saja itu oleh putusan peradilan.

LHKPN senilai Rp 56 miliar dinilai publik janggal sehingga membuat dirinya kini berurusan dengan Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK).Dalam buku berjudul Pengantar Laporan Harta Kekayaan Penyelenggara Negara dijelaskan, LHKPN merupakan daftar keseluruhan kekayaan para penyelenggara negara yang tertuang dalam formulir pencatatan. Penetapannya dilakukan langsung oleh KPK.Dilansir dari elhkpn.kpk.go.id, ada dua pihak utama yang wajib melaporkan LHKPN. Pertama, penyelenggara negara sebagaimana dimaksud dalam Undang-Undang (UU) Nomor 28 Tahun 1999. Kedua, pejabat negara yang menjalankan fungsi eksekutif, legislatif, atau yudikatif.Selain itu, ada pejabat lain yang fungsi dan tugas pokoknya berkaitan dengan penyelenggaraan negara.

Prabowo menegaskan bahwa PartaiGerindra sudah mendeklarasikan dirinya sebagai calon presiden (Capres) dalam pemilihan presiden (Pilpres) 2024. Sedangkan Anies Baswedan, kata Prabowo, diusung sebagai Capres oleh Partai NasDem, Partai Demokrat dan PKS.Prabowo juga secara tegas menolak Sandiaga Uno sebagai pasangan Anies. ""Keputusan partai ini sudah jelas saya calon presidennya, selama dia (Sandiaga) di partai ya dia akan patuh pada garis partai,"" ujar Prabowo saat menerima kunjungan Ketua Umum Partai Nasional Demokrat (NasDem) Surya Paloh di kediamannya, Hambalang, Kabupaten Bogor, Jawa Barat, Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Pernyataan Prabowo itu berkaitan dengan wacana untuk memasangkan Wakil Ketua Dewan Pembina Gerindra, Sandiaga Uno, dengan Anies Baswedan pada Pilpres 2024. Dia menyatakan Sandiaga akan tetap mengikuti keputusan Gerindra selama dia berada di partai itu.Pernyataan tegas Prabowo ini jelas menutup peluang Anies Baswedan berpasangan, baik dengan Prabowo maupun Sandiaga Uno. Lantas, siapa cawapres untuk Anies Baswedan?Direktur EksekutifVoxpol Center Reseach and ConsultingPangi Syarwi Chaniago menyebut pasanganAnies Baswedan- Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (AHY) memiliki peluang unggul lebih tinggi dalam sejumlah simulasi Pilpres 2024.""Pasangan Anies-AHY cenderung lebih signifikan menang dari beberapa simulasi, baik simulasi 4 pasang, 3 pasang maupun 2 pasang,"" ujarnya saat dihubungi, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Data Survei Voxpol per September 2022 lalu menunjukan dengan simulasi model empat pasangan, persentase kemenangan paslon Anies -AHY selalu unggul, dimana eletabilitasnya rata-ratanya di 30 persen ke atas.Misalnya saja, salah satu simulasi dengan empat pasangan. Ada Paslon Puan Maharani- Andhika Perkasa dengan elektabilitas mencapai 2,1 persen. Lalu paslon Ganjar Pranowo-Sandiaga Salahudin Uno dengan elektabilitas 30,9 persen. Juga Paslon Prabowo Subianto-Muhaimin Iskandar elektabilitasnya 23,3 persen.Kemudian dalam simulasi dengan tiga pasangan capres-cawapres, Anies-AHY masih masih unggul dengan elektabilitasnya mencapai 37,3 persen.Dalam simulasi tersebut, Ganjar Pranowo- Airlangga Hartarto dengan elektabilitas 28 persen. Kemudian paslon Prabowo Subianto-Puan Maharani dengan elektabilitas 23, 4 persen.Selanjutnya: Alasan terdongkraknya pasangan Anies-AHYPangi menyebut alasannya terdongkraknya eletabilitas pasangan Anies-AHY karena basis pemilih pada AHY relatif lebih menyebar jika dibandingakan dengan Khofifah salah satu kandidat cawapres.""Anies-AHY terjadi penguatan di DKI, Banten dan Jawa Barat sedangkan Anies-Khofifah hanya menguat di Jawa Timur,"" ungkapnya.Demokrat Inginkan AHY Jadi CawapresSekretaris Majelis Tinggi Partai Demokrat Andi Mallarangeng mengatakan sosok calon wakil presiden diserahkan sepenuhnya pada Anies Baswedan. Kendati demikian, Andi menyebut partainya sudah menyampaikan jika ingin menang, maka pasangan yang disodorkan pada 2024 hendaknya Anies bersama Ketua Umum Demokrat Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono alias AHY.Kalau kami Partai Demokrat, yang kami sampaikan adalah, kalau mau menang ya Anies-AHY, kata Andi di Kantor DPP Partai Demokrat, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023, Anies menyambangi Kantor Demokrat untuk berkenalan dengan jajaran Majelis Tinggi Partai. Andi menjelaskan, aspirasi majelis partai menginginkan bekas Gubernur DKI Jakarta itu berpasangan dengan AHY.Kendati demikian, Andi menyatakan keputusan soal cawapres ini tetap diserahkan kepada Anies.Itu aspirasi dari anggota-anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai. Tapi semua dikembalikan ke Pak Anies, kata dia.Sementara itu, Anies irit bicara kala ditanya ihwal sosok yang bakal mendampinginya padaPilpres 2024. Dia hanya menyebut proses pemilihan cawapres ditunaikan secara bertahap.Bertahap, ujar Anies di Kantor DPP Demokrat, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.AHY mengamini dukungan untuk menjadi Cawapres 2024 mendampingi Anies . Pernyataan itu merespons pertanyaan awak media soal kemungkinan AHY akan maju sebagai cawapres. ""Kalau ada doa yang baik, harapan yang baik, saya amini saja,"" katanya, Sabtu, 8 Oktober 2022.Menurut AHY, dirinya pribadi dan Partai Demokrat memiliki kedekatan dengan Anies dengan agenda silaturahmi politik. Anies pun sempat mengunjungi DPP Partai Demokrat di Pegangsaan, Jakarta Pusat. Ia menemui AHY dalam agenda silaturahmi politik.

Pertemuan itu merupakan kunjungan balasan setelah Prabowo mendatangi Kantor DPP Partai NasDem pada Juni 2022.Dalam pertemuan itu, Prabowo menyatakan dirinya dan Surya Paloh menghormati keputusan politik masing-masing terkait capres dan koalisi. Prabowo Subianto juga menutup kemungkinan dirinya maupun Sandiaga Uno bersanding denganAnies Baswedanpada Pemilihan Presiden (Pilpres) 2024.Apa tanggapan partai Demokrat dan Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) mengenai kunjungan NasDem sebagai bagian dari Koalisi Perubahan ke Gerindra?Demokrat: Bentuk kolaborasi lintas koalisiKoordinator Juru Bicara DPP Partai Demokrat Herzaky Mahendra Putra menanggapi pertemuan NasDem dengan Gerindra kemarin, Ahad, 5 Maret 2023 sebagai bentuk kolaborasi lintas koalisi.Herzaky mengatakan Koalisi Perubahan yang digagas partainya bersama NasDem dan PKS, berupaya menjalin kolaborasi dengan koalisi lainnya. Dia menilai perbedaan cara pandangan dalam membangun bangsa ke depannya, dan berbeda pilihan koalisi hingga calon presiden (capres) masing-masing tak menghentikan kolaborasi tersebut.""Tetapi tetap jalin komunikasi dan silaturahmi. Apalagi sesama parpol di parlemen,"" kata Herzaky dalam keterangan tertulisnya, Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Dia mengatakan soliditas parpol yang berada di parlemen harus diperkuat. Apalagi saat ini, kata dia, konstelasi politik bangsa tengah menghadapi kekuatan di balik layar yang berupaya menunda pemilu.""Dari berupaya mengubah sistem proporsional terbuka menjadi tertutup, sampai berupaya menunda pemilu,"" kata dia.Herzaky menambahkan, setiap bakal capres yang diusung dari masing-masing koalisi merupakan sosok petarung. Mereka, menurut Herzaky,siap berlaga dalam kontestasi yang jujur dan adil menghadapi bacapres dariKoalisi Perubahan, Anies Baswedan.Dia pun meyakini setiap bacapres tersebut tidak akan ikut tergoda mengembalikan negeri ini ke masa kegelapan demokrasi seperti di Orde Baru.""Berupaya menunda pemilu 2024, ataupun malah mengembalikan ke pemilihan presiden melalui MPR,"" kata dia.Selanjutnya: Komentar PKS soal pertemuan NasDem dan GerindraPKS: Memperkuat silaturahimSekretaris Jenderal PKS Habib Aboe Bakar Alhabsy menyebut pertemuan NasDem dengan Gerindra merupakan silaturahim antara ketua umum partai politik menjelang Pemilihan Umum 2024 adalah hal yang baik.Aboe menyebut pertemuan antara ketua umum parpol jelang pemilu bisa menguatkan silaturahim kebangsaan dan sesuatu yang lumrah dilakukan.""Tak ada yang salah dengan silaturahmi antara Pak Surya Paloh dan Pak Prabowo. Malah politik silaturahim ini perlu terus kita kembangkan, komunikasi antar anak bangsa itu sangat diperlukan,"" sebut Aboe, seperti dikutip dari laman PKS, Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Anggota Komisi III DPR RI ini juga menyebut pertemuan antara elite politik justru bisa mengendurkan tensi politik. Pimpinan parpol perlu membangun komunikasi yang baik sehingga menghasilkan suasana yang kondusif.""Di tahun politik ini, silaturahim berperan baik untuk mengendurkan tensi politik. Mungkin banyak hal akan bisa diselesaikan sambil ngopi santai,"" kata dia.Habib Aboe menambahkan, melalui silaturahim, para pengurus partai politik bisa mencari titik titik temu yang mungkin bisa

PKS mengungkap pernah diancam dan dilobi agar tak mendukung Anies Baswedan sebagai Capres 2024. Namun perjalanan panjang itu usai setelah PKS resmi mendeklarasikan Anies sebagai capres 2024 di Kantor DPP PKS Jakarta, Kamis, 23 Februari 2023.Kini PKS melangkah ke babak berikutnya, yaitu bagaimana cara memenangkan Anies saat Pilpres 2024 mendatang. PKS membeberkan 4 strategi yang harus dijalankan kader PKS untuk memenangkan Anies dalam pemilihan presiden (Pilpres) 2024.Pernyataan tersebut disampaikan Presiden PKS Ahmad Syaikhu dalam dialog kebangsaan dengan tema PKS Menang, Anies Presiden di Hotel Aston Purwokerto, Sabtu 4 Maret 2023, seperti dikutip Tempo dari laman resmi PKS, Senin, 6 Maret 2023.Adapun empat strategi politik yang disampaikan Ahmad, yaitu politik kebangsaan, pemberdayaan, silaturahmi dan spiritual. Ahmad menyebut, dialog kebangsaan merupakan sebuah upaya membangun kebersamaan untuk memahami situasi kebangsaan sekarang ini dan berlanjut dengan menata hari esok yang lebih baik.Kita sangat bangga dengan tokoh-tokoh pendahulu, kalau di sini salah satunya adalah Jenderal Soedirman, dimana di tengah sakitnya, beliau tetap memimpin pasukan untuk berjuang meraih kemerdekaan. Sosok seperti ini harusnya muncul di berbagai sisi kehidupan kita saat ini, hal ini lah yang mampu membangkitkan semangat berjuang di berbagai lini kehidupan, itulah politik kebangsaan, jelas Ahmad di hadapan ratusan kader PKS serta relawan Anies Baswedan.Menurut Ahmad, yang tidak kalah pentingnya adalah politik pemberdayaan, dimana kader PKS harus peka dan memberikan bantuan kepada masyarakat yang membutuhkan. Untuk bisa memberi, kata Ahmad, maka sebelumnya harus memiliki terlebih dahulu.Selanjutnya, Ahmad menekankan politik silaturahmi. Setelah menjadi bacaleg, kata Ahmad, semua harus giat jalin tali silaturahmi dengan berbagai kalangan. Komunikasi langsung bertatap muka dengan masyarakat akan memberikan kesan lebih mendalam. Dan terakhir adalah politik spiritual, dimana segala usaha harus diiringi dengan doa.Kita belajar dari Pilkada DKI, dimana saat diusung menjadi calon gubernur, elektabilitas Anies masih paling buncit. Namun, dengan semangat tinggi, kita mampu membawa kemenangan hingga 57 persen. Jika dalam Pilpres nanti kita ingin menang, maka minimal harus mampu meriah suara sama, yaitu 57 persen atau untuk lebih aman harus meraih minimal 60 persen, ujarnya.Selanjutnya: Ancaman dan lobi agar tak dukung Anies BaswedanLobi agar tak dukung Anies BaswedanPKS resmi mendeklarasikan mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies sebagai Bakal Capres 2024 di Kantor DPP PKS, Kamis, 23 Februari 2023.

Indonesia dikenal sebagai negara yang cukup sering mengalami kebakaran. Dilansir dari berbagai sumber, kebakaran yang paling sering adalah kebakaran hutan dan lahan.Tahun 2019 lalu, kebakaran hutan mencapai 857 hektare. Jumlah tersebut meningkat 62 persen dibanding karhutla 2018 dan juga merupakan yang terbesar dalam empat tahun terakhir.Data SiPongi Karhutla Monitoring Sistem mencatat Kalimantan Tengah merupakan provinsi dengan luas karhutla mencapai 134 ribu ha. Disusul Kalimantan Barat dengan karhutla seluas 127 ribu ha dan Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) di urutan ketiga dengan luas 119 ha.Dari 10 provinsi dengan karhutla terluas, empat di antaranya berada di Kalimantan, tiga di Sumatera, dua di Nusa Tenggara, dan satu di Papua. Bencana ini diduga akibat sebagian lahan kosong bekas kebakaran yang beralih fungsi menjadi perkebunan sawit.Sepanjang tahun 2015 hingga 2019, kebakaran paling besar terjadi pada tahun 2015 dan tahun 2019 yang membakar sekitar 2,6 juta dan 1,6 juta ha hutan dan lahan. Bencana tersebut juga didukung oleh kondisi musim kemarau berkepanjangan dan El Nino yang terjadi di Indonesia. Dari dua kebakaran hebat tersebut, sekitar 29% nya terjadi di lahan gambut.Tarik mundur tahun 2014. Sumatera Selatan merupakan provinsi dengan karhutla terluas saat itu. Yakni mencapai 646 ribu ha sekitar 25% dari total. Pada tahun tersebut luas karhutla mencapai 2,6 ha dan merupakan yang terluas dalam enam tahun terakhir.Berdasarkan data dari Pantau Gambut, bencana asap juga menimpa Provinsi Riau dan Aceh. Bahkan hutan dan lahan di kawasan itu sudah terbakar sejak awal tahun 2022. Padahal, Badan Meteorologi Klimatologi dan Geofisika (BMKG) menyatakan awal datangnya musim kemarau tahun 2022 di Indonesia baru akan terjadi pada periode April-Juni dan memasuki puncak musim kemarau pada bulan Juni hingga September 2022.Berdasasarkan hasil analisis Pantau Gambut, area gambut rentan terbakar paling luas berada di Provinsi Riau, yaitu seluas 2 juta ha, disusul oleh Kalimantan Tengah, seluas 1,2 juta ha. Dua provinsi tersebut kerap mengalami kebakaran gambut setiap tahun.Berdasarkan data pemantauan hotspot tahun 2023 jumlah hotspot dari tanggal 1-19 Januari 2023 ada 31 titik. Angkanya ini disebutnya naik 29% dari periode yang sama pada tahun lalu. Menko Polhukam Mahfud MD meminta semua pihak terkait untuk meningkatkan kewaspadaan atas potensi peningkatan kebakaran hutan dan lahan (karhutla) di tahun 2023. Sejalan dengan prediksi BMKG iklim tahun ini akan lebih kering dari tahun 2022.""Dari prediksi BMKG terdapat potensi terjadinya El Nino setelah 3 tahun terakhir 2020, 2021, 2022 terjadi La Nina. Sehingga diperkirakan akan terjadi peningkatan potensi karhutla seperti yang terjadi di tahun 2019,"" ujar Menko Mahfud MD.NOVITA ANDRIAN Pilihan Editor: Kisah Pilu Korban Kebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Terkapar Memeluk AlquranSelalu update info terkini.

Yandri mengatakan kondisi ini sangat miris mengingat mayoritas penduduk Indonesia beragama Islam.""Kita sadar 72 persen itu angka yang mengkhawatirkan,"" kata dia di acara Sosialisasi Empat Pilar MPR dan Sarsehan Nasional Pengentasan Buta Aksara Quran Nasional dengan Dewan Pengurus Pusat Lembaga Pembinaan Qiroatil Quran Indonesia (LPQQ), di lobi DPR RI, Jakarta Pusat pada Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Menurut Yandri, MPR bersama LPQQ didukung oleh pemerintah berupaya mengentaskan permasalahan ini. Ia mengatakan, kehidupan berbangsa dan bernegara tegak lurus dengan nilai sila pertama, yakni Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa.""Bagaimana mau berbangsa dan bernegara dengan baik, kitab suci mereka saja tidak paham. Itu salah satu pengamanatan nilai Pancasila menurut saya,"" kata politikus Partai Amanat Nasional itu.Untuk mengentaskan buta baca Al Quran ini, menurut Yandri akan diadakan sebuah pelatihan khusus untuk para pengajar.""Dengan metode khusus sehingga sekarang orang bisa sangat cepat membaca Alquran,"" kata dia.Kesejahteraan Guru NgajiYandri sempat menyinggung terkait kesejateraan guru mengaji. Hal tersebut dibahasnya menyambung pendapat dari Menteri Pendagangan Zulkifli Hasan yang menjabat sebagai Dewan Penasehat LPQQ.Yandri memamaparkan untuk menunjang kesejahteraan guru mengaji akan diberlakukan skema asnaf zakat.""Ya ini mau saya dialog kan dengan Baznas, karena kan salah satu golongan yang menerima zakat itu kan orang yang berjuang di jalan Allah salah satunya guru ngaji,"" katanya.Yandri mengaku akan membawa perbincangan ini bersama dengan ketua umum dan sekretaris jenderal LPQQ guna menghasilkan dialog berkemajuan untuk guru mengaji.""Memang yang sebagian besar lillahi

Dalam kunjungan itu, Jokowi melihat fasilitas dan alat kesehatan di sana.Jokowi menyebut Rumah Sakit Mayapada memiliki fasilitas dan bangunan yang mumpuni. Namun, Jokowi menyayangkan masih adanya masyarakat yang memilih berobat ke luar negeri.""Informasi yang saya terima hampir 2 juta masyarakat kita itu masih pergi berobat ke luar negeri apabila sakit. Padahal kita memiliki rumah sakit seperti ini. Hampir 2 juta,"" kata Jokowi dalam kunjungan tersebut, Senin, 6 Maret 2023.Jokowi menyebut dari 2 juta masyarakat yang berobat ke luar negeri, sebanyak 1 juta di antaranya pergi ke Malaysia, 750 ribu ke Singapura, dan sisanya ke Jepang, Amerika, Jerman, dan negara lain. Menurut Jokowi, hal tersebut membuat devisa negara hilang.""Mau kita terus-teruskan? Rp165 triliun devisa kita hilang gara-gara itu. Karena ada modal keluar, capital outflow,"" kata Jokowi.Belajar dari hal tersebut, Jokowi menyatakan sangat mendukung pembangunan rumah sakit yang memiliki standar seperti Rumah Sakit Mayapada. Namun, Jokowi mengakui pembangunan rumah sakit berstandar tinggi bukan menjadi satu-satunya masalah.""Dokter spesialisnya masih kurang atau dokter sub spesialis masih kurang. Saya udah bisikin Pak Menkes ini harus diurus,"" kata Jokowi.Jokowi Pernah Keluhkan Hal SerupaSebelumnya, keluhan Jokowi soal masih banyaknya masyarakat yang berobat ke luar negeri juga pernah disampikan saat berkunjung ke Kalimantan Barat pada Agustus 2022. Saat itu, Jokowi mengaku sedih melihat masyarakat yang sakit, namun berobat ke luar negeri""Saya tuh paling sedih kalau mendengar ada warga negara kita yang sakit kemudian perginya ke luar negeri, ke Malaysia, ke Singapura, ada yang ke Jepang, ada yang ke Amerika,"" ujar Jokowi.Jokowi menjelaskan, aliran uang masyarakat untuk berobat ke luar negeri mencapai Rp110 triliun. Salah satu daerah yang warganya sering berobat ke rumah sakit luar negeri dibandingkan dalama negeri adalah Kalimantan Barat.""Khusus untuk Kalimantan Barat, saya mendengar banyak sekali yang ke Kucing (Malaysia),"" ujar Jokowi.Melihat hal tersebut, Jokowi mengatakan saat Pemerintah Pusat mendapat permintaan dari Gubernur Kalimantan Barat untuk menyediakan alat kesehatan di RSUD Dr. Soedarso, ia langsung menyanggupinya.""Habis Rp205 miliar (untuk buat gedung), alat kesehatannya kurang lebih Rp200-an miliar. Ini yang namanya gotong royong untuk menyelesaikan uang yang harus keluar karena tidak siapnya rumah sakit kita,"" ujar Jokowi.Dengan dana ratusan miliar yang digelontorkan itu, Jokowi menyebut RSUD Dr. Soedarso memiliki 277 tempat tidur, ruang operasi, hingga ruang ICU dengan standar super modern.""Jadi saya ingatkan gak usah lah kita keluar, di sini sudah siap dan cukup untuk menangani kasus-kasus yang ada,"" kata Jokowi.Lebih lanjut, Jokowi menyebut pembangunan rumah sakit ini sebagai bagian dari pembelajaran saat pandemi Covid-19 pada 2,5 tahun ke belakang.

Pertama, penyulut kebakaran berawal dari Depo Pertamina Plumpang, bukan rumah penduduk,"" kata Fahmy dalam keterangan tertulisnya Senin 6 Maret 2023.Alasan berikutnya, menurut Fahmy, pemindahan Depo Pertamina Plumpang dapat dilakukan lebih cepat dibandingkan merelokasi rumah warga di kawasan itu.""Pemindahan Depo Pertamina dapat diputuskan secara cepat oleh direksi Pertamina, Sedangkan keputusan relokasi kawasan penduduk lebih lama karena melibatkan beberapa pihak yakni Pertamina, Pemda DKI, dan warga,"" kata dia.Sistem keamanan burukIa menilai saat ini lokasi Depo Pertamina Plumpang sudah sangat tidak layak lantaran berada di tengah kawasan padat penduduk serta tidak tersedia buffer water yang cukup untuk proses pendinginan pipa.Padahal, menurut Fahmy, pendistribusian BBM dari kilang ke Depo Pertamina menggunakan pipa yang sebagian melewati kawasan penduduk, sehingga saat pipa terbakar pasti akan menyebabkan kebakaran rumah penduduk di sekitarnya.""Dengan alasan tersebut, maka hanya satu kata pindahkan Depo Pertamina Plumpang dalam tempo sesingkatnya,"" kata dia.Kebakaran yang kali ketiga terjadi di Depo Pertamina Plumpang dan Kilang Minyak Pertamina, menurut dia, mengindikasikan bahwa sistem kemanan amat buruk, di bawah international standard yang mensyaratkan nihil kecelakaan (zero accidents) bagi asset staretgis dan risiko tinggi.Perintah JokowiKebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara terjadi pada Jumat malam 3 Maret 2023. Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah (BPBD) DKI Jakarta mencatat 17 orang meninggal dunia dalam peristiwa tersebut. Selain itu, terdapat 49 orang luka berat dan 2 orang luka ringan.Saat meninjau salah satu posko korban kebakaran di RPTRA Rasela Rawabadak Selatan, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Minggu (5/3), Presiden Joko Widodo meminta Menteri BUMN Erick Thohir dan Penjabat Gubernur DKI Jakarta Heru Budi Hartono segera mencari solusi atas kejadian itu.""Saya sudah perintahkan Menteri BUMN dan Gubernur DKI segera mencari solusi dari kejadian di Plumpang, terutama karena ini zona yang bahaya. Tidak bisa lagi ditinggali, tetapi harus ada solusinya.

Tahun ini masih ada Rp 1,4 triliun yang masih dalam proses.Ini yang perlu kita sinkronisasikan supaya jangan penyelesaian dari Jiwasraya tertunda karena penyelesaian aset dari administrasi saja, kata Erick Thohir di gedung Kejaksaan Agung, Senin, 6 Maret 2023.Erick mengatakan masih ada kasus Jiwarsaya yang mesti diselesaikan, termasuk pengembalian aset-aset yang telah disita oleh Kejaksaan Agung. Enam bulan ke depan, ujar Erick, adalah momen terpenting penyelesaian Jiwasraya.Bersih-bersih BUMNJaksa Agung Sanitiar Burhanuddin mengatakan kerja sama dengan Kementerian BUMN merupakan upaya untuk bersih-bersih perusahaan pelat merah. Antara lain, mungkin penyelesaian aset-aset Jiwasraya yang cukup menarik dan cukup yang berhubungan dengan masyarakat luas, ujar Jaksa Agung.Kepala Pusat Penerangan Hukum Kejaksaan Agung I Ketut Sumedana mengatakan baru Rp 3,1 triliun sitaan aset kasus Jiwasraya yang diserahkan kepada Kementerian BUMN. Aset ini dalam bentuk surat berharga atau saham.Bentuknya saham.

Vonis nihil diberikan karena Benny sudah mendapat hukuman maksimal dalam kasus korupsi Jiwasraya.""Karena terdakwa sudah dijatuhi pidana seumur hidup dalam perkara PT Asuransi Jiwasraya, maka pidana yang dijatuhkan dalam perkara a quo adalah pidana nihil,"" ujar ketua majelis hakim Ignatius Eko Purwanto di Pengadilan Tipikor Jakarta Pusat, Kamis 12 Januari 2023.Dalam kasus Asabri, jaksa menuntut Benny Tjokrosaputro dengan hukuman mati. Majelis hakim yang terdiri dari Ignatius Eko Purwanto, Saifuddin Zuhri, Teguh Santoso, Ali Mukhtarom dan Mulyono DWi Puryanto menetapkan bahwa Benny Tjokrosaputro terbukti melakukan korupsi dan pencucian uang, tapi majelis hakim tidak bisa menjatuhkan hukuman mati.Pada 26 Oktober 2020, Benny Tjokro divonis penjara seumur hidup oleh Majelis Hakim Pengadilan Tindak Pidana Korupsi Jakarta. Selain itu, majelis hakim mewajibkan Direktur PT Hanson International Tbk itu membayar yang pengganti sebanyak Rp 6 triliun.Hakim menyatakan Benny terbukti melakukan berbagai perbuatan yang membuat negara rugi Rp 16 triliun. Perbuatan itu di antaranya, pengelolaan saham dan reksa dana Jiwasraya, tanpa analisis dan tak sesuai prosedur. Selain korupsi, hakim menyatakan Benny terbukti melakukan pencucian uang.Perbuatan itu dilakukan bersama-sama dengan eks Direktur Utama Jiwasraya Hendrisman Rahim; Direktur Keuangan Jiwasraya 2013-2018, Hary Prasetyo; Kepala Divisi Investasi dan Keuangan Jiwasraya 2008-2014, Syahmirwan; dan Direktur PT Maxima Integra, Joko Hartomo Tirto.

Musababnya, kata dia, PDIP secara otomatis akan bekerja sama dengan PAN, PPP, dan Partai Golkar dalam Koalisi Indonesia Bersatu.PAN akan senang dan gembira. Karena dengan koalisi dengan PPP, secara otomatis akan berkoalisi dengan PAN dan Golkar. Sebab, PPP adalah anggota KIB, kata Viva saat dihubungi, Rabu, 8 Maret 2023.Viva menampik jika peluang koalisi antara PPP dengan PDIP bakal menggoyahkan KIB. Ia menegaskan koalisi yang pertama kali terbentuk ini tetap solid dan kompak.KIB insya Allah tidak akan terbelah. KIB tetap solid dan kompak, kata dia.Menurut Viva, bergabungnya PDIP ke KIB bakal memperbesar peluang memenangkan Pemilihan Presiden 2024. Pasalnya, pasangan calon yang dijagokan berpotensi mendapatkan dukungan yang besar.Maka sudah bisa dipastikan siapapun pasangan calon yang akan diusung di Pilpres 2024 berpotensi mendapatkan dukungan besar dan dapat memenangi kompetisi, kata Viva.Sebelumnya, Pelaksana tugas (Plt) Ketua Umum PPP Muhamad Mardiono menyebut peluang berkoalisi dengan PDIP terbuka lebar. Musababnya, PPP dan PDIP punya kesamaan nilai dan pengalaman historis.Mardiono menjelaskan, PPP dan PDIP termasuk partai tua yang usianya sudah setengah abad. Selain itu, jarak kelahiran kedua partai ini juga berdekatan, yakni PPP pada 5 Januari dan PDIP pada 10 Januari. Tak hanya tanggal berdirinya, Mardiono menyebut lokasi kantor PPP dan PDIP juga bersebelahan.Iya memang kemungkinan itu ada (berkoalisi), kata Mardiono saat dihubungi, Selasa, 7 Maret 2023.Selain itu, Mardiono menyebut kedua partai ini punya ideologi yang saling berhubungan. PPP dengan identitasnya sebagai partai religius, sementara PDIP dengan identitasnya sebagai partai nasionalis.Menurut Mardiono, ideologi religius dan nasionalis ini punya cara pandang yang sama dalam membangun bangsa Indonesia. Bagaimana kemudian membangun bangsa itu juga harus dilandasi dengan moral, ujarnya.Komunikasi PPP dengan PDIP disebut Mardiono juga berlangsung dengan baik hingga saat ini. Saat bersua dan berkomunikasi, dia mengatakan obrolan-obrolan politik ihwal ajakan berkoalisi jelang Pilpres tak terhindarkan.Bagi PPP, kata Mardiono, obrolan itu merupakan upaya politik yang dilakukan partai. Pasalnya, PPP termasuk partai kecil dengan suara sebesar 4,5 persen. Sementara PDIP, kata dia, merupakan satu-satunya parpol yang bisa mencalonkan kandidat capres cawapresnya sendiri.Ya tentu upaya mengajak koalisi, apalagi ini PPP termasuk partai kecil. Tentu berusaha mengajak koalisi dengan partai lain, itu bagian dari upaya yang dilakukan parpol, kata Mardiono.Dalam waktu dekat, Mardiono menyebut partai berlambang kabah ini akan bersilaturahmi dengan PDIP.
